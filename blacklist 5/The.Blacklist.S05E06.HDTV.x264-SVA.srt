He found me through

68

71
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,833
the hit was contracted
through the Travel Agency.

72
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,234

73
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,070

Their assassins carried out
a variety of contract hits

78
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,603

closed their doors 12 years ago,

79

law enforcement might one day

80
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:05,448
solve the rash of killings
the Agency left in their wake.

beginning with Mitchell Dunning.

84
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,546
The Travel Agency was a
consortium of anonymous killers

85
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,583
responsible for a variety
of unsolved murders...

86
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:23,086
the assassination of
a civil-rights activist in 1983,

87
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,181
the poisoning of an
anti-Glasnost Soviet businessman

88
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,386

90
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:30,026
who Reddington says
is the next target?

91
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,428
Mitchell David Dunning.

92
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,998

a talent you and I share.

170
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,966
Or <i>shared.</i>
I'm out of that business.

171
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,237
And if I have a quest,
it's to shine a light

172

on the darkness you create...

173
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:38,544
to help Liz find her way out
of the enormous shadow you cast.

174
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,269
You asked Nik to identify the bones,

175
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,538
and he was killed for his trouble

176
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,841
by someone who knows their identity

177
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,678
and, therefore, their value.

178
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:53,047
That killer is likely searching
for a way to contact me

179
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,982
since, knowing their value,

180
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:58,647
he knows they are
most valuable to me.

181
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,494
I will allow myself to be found,
recover the suitcase,

182
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:07,197
eliminate the man for his troubles,

183
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,866
and rebury the body in a place

184
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:12,202
where it will be lost
to the sands of time,

185
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:14,671

186
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:18,166

you're hiding from Liz...

497
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,218
I thought I did.

498
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,687
Then again,
I thought he was married.

499

about the bones I gave him,</i>

500

it won't be labeled</i>

<i>or easy to find, so you got to
upload everything.</i>

502
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:14,308
Who tells someone they're
married when they're not?

503
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,576
<i>Isn't it usually
the other way around?</i>

504
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:18,178
Pete's a con artist.
He conned us both.

505
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,714
<i>He killed my friend, and now
he's sent someone to frame you.</i>

00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,120
We were told he lived here.

509
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:28,922
He does.

510
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,958
But he's with Eleanor now...
his wife.

511
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,894
She stops by occasionally and
takes him out for a day or so.

512
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,063
Can you tell us
about his condition?

513
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:40,678
Calvin was injured years ago
in a robbery...

514
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,303
beaten badly and left for dead.

515
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,840
Truthfully, he's lucky
to have survived it at all.

516
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,410
But the brain injury left him
with anterograde amnesia.

517
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:51,845
And what does that mean?

518
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,314
Calvin can't form new memories.

519
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:55,749
He can operate in the present,

520
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:59,152
but what happen 10 hours
or 10 days ago,

521
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:01,221
for him,
it's as if it never happened.

522
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:03,190
But his long-term memory
is still intact?

523
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,226
Yes... everything that happened
prior to the injury.

524
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,328
End of an era, huh?
As far as he's concerned,

525
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,608
the last 30 years didn't happen.

526
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:12,602
He can do the same puzzle,

527
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:14,771
read the same book,
eat the same meal...

528
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:17,440
"Epoch." every time, it's brand-new.

529
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:21,144
What about when he sees
a new car or a flat-screen TV?

530
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:23,046
Well, visual cues that are in conflict

531
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:26,216
with his world view...
that's he's living in 1989...

532
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:27,450
simply don't register.

533
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:30,520
They go into his

573

I told you... there's been...

574
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:47,982
an incident.

575
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:50,952
The wife... he lied to her.

576
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:54,333
Led her to believe he worked
at an actual travel agency,

577
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,445
had a normal life.

578
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,214
She had no idea.

579
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,417
I was just trying to get by,
trying to take care of you.

580
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,953
After the accident,
somehow, somewhere,

581
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,255
there was a slip-up,
and she picked up on it.

582
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,038
I was at the bank,
trying to figure out

583
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:10,154
how to keep up with
the medical bills...

584
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,609
<i>your</i> medical bills...
when the bank manager asked me

585
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:16,379
why I hadn't dipped into
your personal account.

586
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,447
What account?
Eleanor, I don't understand.

587
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,316
That's exactly what I said.

588
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:22,318
She stumbled onto his finances.

589
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,322
I was able to connect the dots
by following the money.

590
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:29,825
Your travels were like a map.

591
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:32,834
A congressman from Utah murdered

592
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,259
while he was in Salt Lake.

593
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:37,695
A South African police general
gunned down...

594
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,664
while he was in Cape Town.

595
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:43,701
You can't imagine
how angry and afraid I was

596
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,904
to find out that
the man that I loved,

597
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:49,107
the father of my children,

598
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,142

what day it is,

00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:57,722
so she just kept digging.

602
00:27:57,724 --> 00:28:00,792
Every name, every number.

603
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,397
It took me four years
to get to the Travel Agency,

604
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,967
and another six
to figure out who worked there.

605
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:11,836
Finally, she figured out
his protocols...

606
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:14,105
The codes, the systems.

607
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,907
...how the long-defunct Travel Agency

608
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,475
communicated with their assets.

609
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:21,725
The post box in Seven Valleys
was the final piece.

610
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,182
I figured out how it worked.

611
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:28,172
The pages, the dossiers.

612
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:31,209
And she used those same protocols

613
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:33,110
to run her husband.

614
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,912
Took advantage of his amnesia,

615
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,849
making him believe
it was still 1989,

616
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,668
using him as her own
contract killer...

617
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,156
to take out those
in the Travel Agency.

618
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,585
All the while, he had no idea.

619
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,437
Wh... wh... wh... whatever...

620
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,307

Oh, I know exactly what you did.

622
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,214
But you don't.
Because you forget everything.

He got out of the car
to see for himself.

627
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,185
Officer told him
to get back in the vehicle.

628

But he'd paid for the tags.

there had to be some mistake.

He was unarmed.

631
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:32,160
He just wanted to
see for himself.

632
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,195
Officer gave him
a second warning.

633
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,031
When he reached to
get his wallet,

634
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,025
the officer shot him.

635
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,416
Six times.

636
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,685
Isaiah watched the man
who murdered his father

00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:47,954
tried and acquitted on all accounts.

638
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:50,731
For him... for so many like him...

639
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,426
it's the gospel truth that
if you're black in this country

640
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:55,861
and you say the wrong word,
you could be killed.

641
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,998
Ask the wrong question,
look the wrong way,

642
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,532
you can be killed.

643

Almost every cop I've served
with, black or white,

644
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,440
I'd be proud to
call my brother.

645
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,408
It tears me up
knowing what so many people

646
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,743
in my community think of them...

647
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,979
just like it tears me up
knowing that the cops

648
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,180
who kill my other brothers

649
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,515
will almost never be
held responsible.

650
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,850
Harold, your justice system
protects those cops

651
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,418
as it will protect you,

do to Zeke Wilson.

And if you choose to
hold him responsible

657
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:41,291
for what happened to Isaiah's father

658
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:44,261
or for all the people of color
who are killed...

659
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:47,598
for saying the wrong thing
or looking the wrong way,

660
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,166
you can do that.

00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:54,471
You may be black, Harold,
but you carry a badge,

662
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,908
and like it or not,
that means you're a made man.

663
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,540
Your justice system
will protect you,

Is that your observation
or your advice?

666
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,215

The reason we can't find Pete is
he's not using his accounts.
