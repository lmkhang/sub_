1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,896
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,174
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,676
with only one goal--
to save my city,

4
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:08,443
but I couldn't honor that
commitment

5
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:11,546
and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son,

6
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:13,682
so I asked the best man I know
to help.

7
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:15,250
His name is John Diggle,

8
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:18,887
and he is the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,689
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:22,691
Pollard--
she's using last night's disaster

11
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,126
as a pretext to
introduce her

12
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:26,862
anti-vigilante legislation
to the council.

13
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,564
I am invoking chapter 9
of the city charter.

14
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,666
That will convert
councilwoman Pollard's bill

15
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:33,568
to a citywide
referendum.

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,736
What do you want?

17
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,738
To operate
without interference.

18
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,740
So you can keep
killing people?

19
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,842
You don't seem to know
that this is a war.

20
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:44,079
The Intel that you
gave me on my son Joe panned out,

21
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:45,847
so I'm heading
to Calgary.

22
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,182
Good luck, Slade.

23
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,597
Ms. Pollard.

24
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:05,100
Captain wanted you to
see the latest CompStat.

25
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:06,801
Thanks, Lieutenant.

26
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:14,709
Sniper!

27
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,078
Aah!

28
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,921
Officer down.
Code 3.

29
00:01:25,923 --> 00:01:27,122
All units respond.

30
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:37,306

32
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,574
Well, I'm just glad
no one was seriously hurt.

33
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:47,242
How do you want
to handle this?

34
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,077
I'd like you to
issue a statement on my behalf.

35
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,212
On your behalf?

36
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:52,147
I have an old friend
in town

37
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,382
that needs my help,
and I might not be back

38
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,084
in the office
for a few hours.

39
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:58,019
Do we have any idea
who the shooter was targeting?

40
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,254
We're working on it.

41
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:02,357
Good. Um, be the mayor
until I get back.

42
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,725
For real?

43
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,694
No. It's
a figure of speech,

44
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,797
but j--just don't make any laws
while I'm out of the office, ok?

45
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:10,665
Fine.

46
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,867
And don't worry
about the shooter.

47
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,369
We're gonna nail
his ass.

48
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,837
I know you will.

49
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,710
Sorry.
That was work.

50
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,845
Don't apologize.

51
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:26,047
I appreciate
the meeting.

52
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,250
You helped me find my son.

53
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,151
Least I can is help
you find Joe.

54
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:32,821
He doesn't go
by that name anymore.

55
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,356
Changed his name?

56
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,725
It was his
mother's idea.

57
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:39,160
Her maiden name.

58
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,696
He goes by Kane now.

59
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,198
What happened
to him?

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,267
I tracked him
to Calgary,

61
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,103
but by then, he'd gone,

62
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:51,206
so I followed him
to Ibiza--heh--

63
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,174
and then Mombassa.

64
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,876
Mombassa?

65
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:59,881
The kid took
after his father.

66
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,683
While we were stuck
on Lian Yu,

67
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:06,021
he went out and joined
the Australian Intelligence Service.

68
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,889
Then a week ago
in Kasnia,

69
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,725
a mission
went south.

70
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,227
He was dealing in arms.

71
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,729
Some locals caught him.

72
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,431
Supposedly, he didn't
have a fair trial,

73
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,500
and now he's...

74
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,002
serving a life sentence

75
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,104
like a rat in a cage.

76
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,343
Ok, Slade.
What do you need?

77
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,517
I need you to help me
find my son.

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,018
Last we met,
you told me

79
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,220
that I couldn't live
in two worlds.

80
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:42,524
I'm not asking you
to come back in.

81
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:48,029
Strangely enough, what
I need is diplomacy,

82
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:50,465
which means I don't
want Green Arrow.

83
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,100
I need Oliver Queen.

84
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:53,501
For what?

85
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,136
Can I ask you
just to trust me

86
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:57,238
on this one, kid?

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,442
I've organized transport
to Kasnia.

88
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,544
Wheels up at 2200.

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,913
I'll understand

90
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:06,981
if you
don't want to join me...

91
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:13,154
But if you do,
I'll meet you out front

92
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:16,925
at 2100, ok, kid?

93
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:29,437
Ok. Bring the stuff over here.

94
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,640
Sorry.

95
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,312
Hey. Don't worry.

96
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:40,115
It's only tent poles.

97
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:43,084
It's not like we're gonna stick around
long enough to use them.

98
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,956
Why do you say that?

99
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,924
You're always leaving.

100
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:51,893
Can't believe we
even made it this far.

101
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:53,595
Listen. You know that I work
for Australian Airlines

102
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,330
and I have to travel,

103
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,499
but I promise you
this weekend

104
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,801
it's just about
you and me,

105
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:03,037
father and son
out in the wild.

106
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,174
Come on. Go find
some flat land

107
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,176
and pitch your tent.

108
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,988
Got him. Well, I didn't
get him-get him,

109
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,156
but I identified him.

110
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,791
- Identified who?
- Our sniper.

111
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,459
Thought your T-spheres
could track his visor.

112
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,262
Well, that was then.
This is apparently now.

113
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,497
He must have hacked
the tracer.

114
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,132
Or got a new visor.

115
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:33,101
It's not like they sell
them at Walmart, Felicity.

116
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,036
Guys, update time.
I think our vigilante's back in town.

117
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,371
He's the shooter?

118
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:37,906
I saw him coming out
of the sniper's nest.

119
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:40,875
CSU's here.
Don't know how much evidence

120
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:42,510
we'll be able
to pull.

121
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:43,878
Well, why don't
we work with what we have,

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,313
mainly the vigilante
seemed to be targeting

123
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,614
councilwoman Pollard.

124
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:48,216
"Seemed to be" being
the operative word.

125
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,484
Well, Pollard's the one
who's championing

126
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,352
the anti-vigilante bill.

127
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,887
Seems like a guy named
vigilante wouldn't like her much.

128
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,689
Yeah, but martyr her?
That would get this bill

129
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,858
passed faster than you
could say "obstruction."

130
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,359
If it passes,
I'm gonna have to consider

131
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:00,161
arresting myself.

132
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:05,467
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?

133
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,168
You're not SCPD.

134
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,671
No, he's not,
and this is not a federal case.

135
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,139
Still doesn't explain
what John Diggle,

136
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,907
who works personal security
for the mayor,

137
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,476
is doing
at a crime scene.

138
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,144
I have relevant
experience,

139
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:18,813
and the mayor thought
this could use a fresh set of eyes.

140
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,516
What type
of experience?

141
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:23,318
Sniper.

142
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,753
I don't recall reading that in
your military file.

143
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:27,255
I'm sorry.
Tell me again why

144
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:28,957
you're reviewing
my service jacket.

145
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,825
Mayor Queen didn't
mention he was under investigation.

146
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,760
Of course he did.
It has nothing to do with that.

147
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:33,928
But you've been
working with him

148
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,430
for the past
6 years,

149
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,699
which makes us
overdo for a chat.

150
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:41,236
I could wait for
a subpoena if you'd prefer.

151
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:43,204
No. I'm an open book.

152
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:46,107
Step into my office.

153
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:49,577
Uh-uh! Private
conversation.

154
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:56,417
Hey, William.

155
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,753
Hi.

156
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:01,556
How are those quadratic
equations going?

157
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:02,857
I hate them.

158
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,859
Yeah. Those were
the days.

159
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,427
Where's your dad?

160
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,129
In his room.

161
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,535
Ah. Do you remember
when our biggest problem in life

162
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:15,370
was solving
a quadratic equation?

163
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:19,941
Uh-uh. I mean, I never really worried
about them, but no.

164
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:24,913
Well, now we have metas
crashing bachelorette parties, so--wow.

165
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,982
Slade invited you
on a romantic getaway?

166
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,651
- Something like that.
- Where?

167
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,619
Don't say Aruba.
That's our spot.

168
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,121
Kasnia.

169
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:34,422
Wow!

170
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,691
His son is
in some trouble.

171
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,826
The kind of trouble you need
to get in more trouble to fix it?

172
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:42,463
Well, Slade says that
he has a diplomatic solution

173
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,533
that requires my name
and not me in a mask.

174
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:46,935
I'm worried that
if I don't go,

175
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:49,571
he'll take a more
aggressive approach.

176
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:52,206
So the empty bag,
is that second thoughts

177
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,376
or can't decide what
t-shirt to pack?

178
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:59,013
Because I'm out.

179
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,515
I made a promise
to my son,

180
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:02,250
and I'm out.

181
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,485
It sounds like you
made a promise to Slade, too.

182
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,321
You think I should go?

183
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:09,190
It's not like you're
going back to your old life.

184
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:11,292
I wanted you to tell me
not to go.

185
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:13,328
Look. Slade is not
my favorite person,

186
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,031
but, I mean, it's not
about Slade.

187
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,235
- It's about his son.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:23,271
If you don't go, you're just gonna beat
yourself up about it.

189
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,273
If--when it veers
from diplomacy

190
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,941
and I have to break
my promise to William,

191
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,644
I will beat myself up
over that, too.

192
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:30,778
Don't tell William
what you're doing.

193
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,847
- What?
- Spare him the details

194
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,850
of, you know,
Slade being...Slade

195
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:39,253
and tell him that
you're helping a friend.

196
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:41,923
He'll understand that.

197
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,926
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

198
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,761
He's his father's son.

199
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,351
How long's
this flight?

200
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,623
It's about 12 hours.

201
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,761
Thanks for coming, kid.

202
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:21,596
Let's go get your boy.

203
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,651
SCPD!

204
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,390
Hey!

205
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:00,268
Stay down.

206
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,315
It's you.

207
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,867
Got your 911.
Is everything ok?

208
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,337
Look at her face.
That is not an ok face.

209
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:39,674
Dinah?

210
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,310
Vigilante
made another move

211
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:45,079
on councilwoman Pollard
tonight.

212
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:46,948
I almost got him.

213
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,750
It's cool, D.

214
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:50,918
We'll nail that bastard.

215
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,321
I hit him
with my cry.

216
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,089
I shattered
his visor,

217
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,924
and he--he took off
his mask.

218
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:00,962
I saw his face.

219
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,563
Can you I.D. him?

220
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,099
His name is
Vincent Sobel.

221
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,303
He's my old partner.

222
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:11,139
I'm sorry.
When you say partner,

223
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:14,041
do you mean partner,
or do you mean "partner"?

224
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:16,577
- Both.
- Now I'm confused.

225
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,379
Dinah, I thought you said
your partner died in the line.

226
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:22,450
He was shot in the head right
in front of me.

227
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:35,830
Ok. Well, I know you believe you saw
what you saw tonight,

228
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:38,800
but it was night
and probably dark.

229
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,469
It was him,
Felicity.

230
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:44,472
It was Vincent.
I know it.

231
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:46,007
I know it sounds
crazy.

232
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,476
Dinah, this doesn't
change anything.

233
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,845
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

234
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,147
Yeah, I know.
I know.

235
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,348
Where are you
with, the, uh,

236
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,817
shell casing
John found?

237
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,785
The casing appears
to be magnetized.

238
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:59,153
- Bullets aren't magnetic.
- They can be if they're

239
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,388
stored in an environment

240
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,057
with a strong
magnetic field.

241
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,996
You think it's something
you can trace?

242
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:10,698
I like your optimism.

243
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,433
It's not optimism,
Felicity.

244
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,035
It's faith.

245
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:17,104
Dinah said that you
had a chat

246
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,506
with our FBI BFF.

247
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,842
Oh, yes.
She was tough,

248
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,343
but I pushed back
pretty hard.

249
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,711
Think we put
that to bed.

250
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:24,879
Good.

251
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,183
Hello?

252
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,385
Special agent Watson.

253
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:34,555
Yes. Sure. I can come by tomorrow.
No problem.

254
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:36,691
All right.
See you then.

255
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,626
Definitely not
put to bed.

256
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,864
So where's your
point of contact?

257
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:46,067
I don't know.
His name's Nylander.

258
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,070
Foreign associate of mine from back
in the service days.

259
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,706
He's a bit of a jackass
and never on time.

260
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,675
He's not
that bad.

261
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:58,946
Ha ha! Slade Wilson,
the Terminator.

262
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,649
I haven't heard
that name in a while.

263
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,618
See you're running
later than usual.

264
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,886
Yeah. I was
with a girl.

265
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:07,288
Forget about it.
Look at you.

266
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,057
Mirakuru did
you wonders, huh?

267
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,425
Oh, what? You're
not sensitive

268
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,694
about that skit,
are you?

269
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,297
You were quite
the madman, I hear.

270
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,733
You promised me something.
Did you bring it,

271
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,669
or did I waste my time
traveling 7,000 miles

272
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,271
for you to screw with me?

273
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,506
Truth be told,

274
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,842
I'm glad you got
your marbles back.

275
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,513
So who's this?

276
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,982
He's a friend of mine.
Don't worry about him.

277
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:38,019
With you,
I always worry.

278
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,489
This should work. Thank you.

279
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,957
That's it?
Just "thank you"?

280
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,359
No extravagant
dinner, no pints?

281
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,862
Maybe next time
when my son isn't rotting

282
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:50,131
in a third-world prison.

283
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,000
He's lucky to have
you as a father.

284
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,735
My son wouldn't be
in this mess

285
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:57,838
if anybody else was
his father.

286
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,607
Just be careful,
Kamrat.

287
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:02,944
Your boy was snooping
around some private-op mercenaries,

288
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,212
um, not so nice
guys.

289
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,885
Under certain circumstances,

290
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,520
I'm not so nice a guy.

291
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:22,697
Eh. Not so big
into decoration, are you?

292
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,132
I'm less enthusiastic
for people wasting my time.

293
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,500
Ok.

294
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:27,868
You're seeing
Oliver Queen again.

295
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,470
Yeah. These new
prescription glasses

296
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:32,573
are really working
wonders. Heh heh.

297
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,342
It was just a little...

298
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:36,944
FBI interrogation
humor, you know?

299
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,879
Your Mr. Queen's alibi
for certain evenings

300
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,181
where the Green Arrow
was active.

301
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,749
If you say so.

302
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,751
My point is are you
prepared to testify under oath

303
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:45,319
under the pains
and penalties of perjury

304
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,154
in support
of those alibis?

305
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:49,023
Yeah, absolutely.

306
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,492
100%. Super-ready.

307
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,166
Everything
all right?

308
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,268
Mm-hmm.

309
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,105
Yeah. I'm just late
for a coffee date,

310
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:06,707
so I'd like to...

311
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,977
- Go?
- Go.

312
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:13,114
Thank you.
This was pleasant.

313
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:19,320
I call this play
Liberty watch.

314
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:22,857
A famous American mayor
comes to small, war-torn Kasnia

315
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,594
to fight for the release of a man
who has been wrongfully accused.

316
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,062
That's very clever.

317
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:30,364
Like I said, it's
a diplomatic solution.

318
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,433
Well, Slade, still,
I don't think that

319
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:35,703
they're gonna free your son just because
I give them a photo op.

320
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:38,339
Well, the photo op
is just to gain entry.

321
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:41,742
Of course they'll need
a reason to release him,

322
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,611
and here are 50,000.

323
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:48,516
Assuming this works,
where do we meet?

324
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:52,086
When you pick up Joe,
go straight to the airport.

325
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:54,555
Here is an alias
passport for him

326
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,491
and tickets
for you both to London.

327
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:06,133
You're not
even gonna see him?

328
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,668
I need you to
promise me

329
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,837
that you won't tell
him I helped.

330
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,839
No. I'm not gonna lie
to your son.

331
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:14,241
It's better this way.

332
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,144
For him or for you?

333
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:18,979
Wait. Are you--

334
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,215
are you afraid that
he's gonna see you

335
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:24,919
as Deathstroke
and not the man you were,

336
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:28,456
the--the man I think
you are now?

337
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,759
I gave up my right
to be his father

338
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:36,330
when I stepped out
of the light into the shadows

339
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:39,500
and became
this monster.

340
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,469
Your son will forgive you

341
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,472
the way that my son
forgave me.

342
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,841
Joe knew that I was
coming to look for him,

343
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,477
so he contacted
his mother,

344
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:53,280
and she sent me
a message to stay away.

345
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:58,886
You got your
second chance, kid,

346
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,788
and I'm happy for you.

347
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,495
Some fathers aren't
that lucky.

348
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,570
So tell me this is not
the freshest fish

349
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:17,872
that somebody's
cooked for you.

350
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,274
I don't even like
fish.

351
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,309
Not all fish are
the same.

352
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,711
Trust me, kid.

353
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,417
Are you really
a pilot?

354
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:34,388
- Of course I am.
- Stop lying.

355
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,323
Why are you being
like this?

356
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:38,893
We never get
free trips.

357
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:42,196
My friend Nick's dad
flies for Ferris Air.

358
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:45,399
They get free trips
all the time.

359
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:58,646
Unfortunately, I work
for a cheaper airline

360
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:02,449
that doesn't allow
for free vacations.

361
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,786
Whatever.
I'm not hungry.

362
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,360
Don't walk too far.

363
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:26,674
This place used
to house MRI machines.

364
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,075
We're in
the right place.

365
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,743
That's all
that matters.

366
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,245
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

367
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,113
- How was it with Watson?
- Terrifying.

368
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:35,115
We knew she was planning
a case against Oliver,

369
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:38,452
but I'm starting to think her
net is widening to include us.

370
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,354
She hasn't contacted
me yet.

371
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,455
Wait. Why hasn't she?

372
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,057
How about we not
worry about this

373
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,060
while we're in the lair
of a psycho killer? Sorry.

374
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,428
Here.

375
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,802
There's enough ordnance here
for a small war.

376
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:58,372
You don't need this many bullets
for one councilwoman.

377
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:00,975
When you called Vince
a psycho killer,

378
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:02,610
you weren't wrong.

379
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,186
Mr. Queen.

380
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,321
Thank you for taking
the time.

381
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,890
It is not every day
I meet celebrity.

382
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,325
- I'm not famous.
- I saw you on news once.

383
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:20,961
You punched man
with camera. Heh.

384
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,596
Yeah. I sure did.

385
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:26,667
They also say you are quite good
with bow and arrow.

386
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,336
Oh, don't believe
everything that you see on TV.

387
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:31,438
Ok, ok.

388
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,541
I understand you're
with organization in hopes--

389
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,678
To request the release of one
of your prisoners--

390
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,446
Kane Wolfman.

391
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,150
I wish you'd come
earlier.

392
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,234
What are you doing
back here?

393
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:05,673
Where is my son?

394
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:11,312
Uh...There was
a--a fight

395
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:16,917
in the prison yard that
Joe tried to break up.

396
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,355
Someone pushed,
and he hit his head.

397
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:25,092
He's gone.

398
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,235
He never knew.

399
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,705
Never knew what?

400
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,111
That I loved him.

401
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,413
Sure he did, Slade.

402
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,549
I don't remember
the last time...

403
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,553
When I told him.

404
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,221
Well, you were
his father.

405
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,623
Trust me, he knew.

406
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:07,099
I should have come
with you to the prison.

407
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,433
I know it wouldn't
have made any difference,

408
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:14,640
but...at least I could
have seen him,

409
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,308
said good-bye.

410
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,412
We still can.

411
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,284
You can still
say good-bye.

412
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,626
Joe!

413
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,428
Good catch.

414
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,131
Come on. We're not
here to mope around.

415
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:42,768
Ha ha!

416
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,173
Excuse me.

417
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,108
Could you take a photo
of my son and I?

418
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,510
Sure.

419
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,921
- I'm Slade.
- Darryl. Nice to meet you.

420
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,857
- This is my son Joe.
- Hey, Joe.

421
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,325
Nice to meet you.

422
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,861
Come on.

423
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,040
Don't burn
yourself out, Dinah.

424
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,743
We need you for
the long haul, remember?

425
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,245
There is no long haul.

426
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,447
We're putting
this bastard down.

427
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:29,715
Dinah, this bastard was
your partner

428
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:30,949
and your boyfriend.

429
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,818
I don't need you to
remind me of that, thanks.

430
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,419
No, you don't need me

431
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,888
to remind you of that,

432
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,823
but you do need someone
to point out the fact

433
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,024
that perhaps a part of you

434
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,392
should be happy
to have him back.

435
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,728
John, when
Vince died, I did

436
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,430
my absolute best
to kill myself.

437
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,267
I became somebody I
didn't even recognize--

438
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,701
to avenge somebody

439
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,069
who I don't even
recognize anymore,

440
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,738
somebody who kills
innocent people.

441
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,406
You and Vince went
through something horrific.

442
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,475
You did some things
you regret.

443
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,877
Maybe there's a part of you
that's putting that on him.

444
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,445
John, he's
a psychopath.

445
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,847
Doesn't change the fact
that he's someone

446
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,884
who needs help, Dinah,
just like you did.

447
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:10,422
Sorry to interrupt,
but we've got two new problems.

448
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,658
Pollard's headed over to
do a sit-down at channel 52

449
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,626
to talk about
the anti-vigilante referendum.

450
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,061
Wait. No. That
station's not secure.

451
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,663
SCPD cannot
protect her there.

452
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,298
That's why I said
we've got a problem.

453
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,232
What's the second one?

454
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,700
Agent Watson
subpoenaed me.

455
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,268
I got to go, right?

456
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,670
Yeah. That's usually
what a subpoena means--

457
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,505
you have to go.

458
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,272
Well, I'm gonna
head to the news station,

459
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,874
see if I can give Pollard
some extra protection.

460
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,509
Dinah, if Vince
tries anything--

461
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,244
I know, John.
I've got it.

462
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,052
Mr. Queen, I was not
expecting a return visit.

463
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:46,158
Uh, warden, this
is Kane Wolfman's father.

464
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,827
He wishes to see
his son's body.

465
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,029
I am afraid that
won't be possible.

466
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,999
Why? You said
he passed only days ago.

467
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,436
- Yes, but--
- Warden, where's the body?

468
00:23:57,438 --> 00:24:01,440
It is no longer
in my possession.

469
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,742
Then where is
my son's body?

470
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,144
Hey, hey.
Easy, easy.

471
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,017
He's lying.

472
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,652
Do you want me to contact
Liberty watch?

473
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,387
Do you want me to cause
an international incident?

474
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,955
Because I am prepared
to do both.

475
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,991
The situation is
complicated.

476
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,826
- Then uncomplicate it!
- Hey.

477
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,931
Trust me on this one.

478
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,667
Don't make
this man angry.

479
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:34,239
They are called
the Jackals,

480
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,142
the men your son
investigated.

481
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,777
When they discovered
his arrest,

482
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,347
which was merely him
being in wrong place at wrong time,

483
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,349
they broke into prison,
take him.

484
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,451
Why did they
take him?

485
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,421
Torture.
Your son is spy.

486
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:53,492
In his head, secrets
worth millions.

487
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,727
They threatened reprisal
on my family

488
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,697
if I spoke about it.

489
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,465
Slade, Slade.

490
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,967
When the Jackals
took my son,

491
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,202
they didn't count
on who his father was.

492
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,519
Ok. Every single person
in that line is I.D.ed twice.

493
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,480
You got it? I don't care
if it's your mother,

494
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:17,716
and I want two officers
at every emergency exit,

495
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:19,484
and I need somebody
to move this car.

496
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,689
Lieutenant Drake,
good to see you again.

497
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:32,531
All right.
We're nearly ready to move

498
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,698
on the news station.

499
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,267
Dinah's already
on site.

500
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,369
Coffee date.

501
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,371
E-mailing Oliver?

502
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,973
Yeah. I'm just sending
Oliver some info he asked me for,

503
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:45,043
you know, for his
adventures with Slade.

504
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,311
Are you having as much
trouble with Oliver

505
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,913
working with Slade
as I am?

506
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,715
No. I'm having
a lot more.

507
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,552
Rationally, I know that it
was the Mirakuru

508
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,620
that make him
a jerk, but...

509
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,822
But he wasn't
on Mirakuru

510
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,056
when he left us
on Lian Yu.

511
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,858
- Exactly.
- It's ironic that Oliver

512
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,626
has more honor than
the man he's helping.

513
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:04,196
"Ironic" isn't
the word I would use.

514
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:05,797
Guys, we got
a problem.

515
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,432
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that--

516
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,934
Listen. I'm gonna
need you to stand down, ok?

517
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:10,535
Do not come here.

518
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:11,870
Dinah, we're not
standing down.

519
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,472
We're not leaving you
out there alone.

520
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:15,040
Well, I'm not alone.

521
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:17,175
Agent Watson is here,
and she brought friends.

522
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,277
She's hoping the Green Arrow
will show up.

523
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,745
Look. You guys
stay put, ok?

524
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,247
I got this.

525
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,222
I asked Felicity
for any Intel

526
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,190
she could find
on the Jackals.

527
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,292
She hacked the databases
of every major intelligence agency

528
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,094
in the world.

529
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,229
And what did she find?

530
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:39,898
Nothing. These guys
are ghosts.

531
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:42,167
Well, that's no help.

532
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,269
This is. Using
closed circuit cameras

533
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,871
in the prison
and surrounding areas,

534
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,606
she got their
escape route,

535
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:48,874
the license plates,
and then using

536
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,275
keyhole satellite
technology...

537
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,144
She tracked them
to one location.

538
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,545
- Yes, she's did.
- She's brilliant,

539
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,881
so how did you
get her?

540
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,816
Ask myself that
every day.

541
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,188
What's in there
for me?

542
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,124
Nothing. I promised you
your only part in this was talking.

543
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,927
Circumstances
have changed.

544
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,462
Not for you.

545
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,397
You've got your feet
planted in one world,

546
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,899
and you should
keep them there.

547
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,434
Slade, these Jackals are the best
of the worst,

548
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,903
all right?

549
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:19,738
They are
stone-cold killers.

550
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,439
What do you think
I am?

551
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,841
I think that you're
outnumbered,

552
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,309
and quite frankly,

553
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,111
I think that you're
out of practice,

554
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:29,614
and I am not letting
you do this alo--no.

555
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:41,793
Alone is what
I do best, kid.

556
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,865
Go ahead.
Tell me the truth.

557
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,377
Not bad.

558
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,313
Heh heh heh.

559
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,959
I have to go
to the bathroom.

560
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,694
I'll be back soon.

561
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,639
You are Xien Ming,
an agent

562
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,308
for the ministry of defense,
People's Republic.

563
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,345
I am looking for an agent
who you black bagged

564
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:35,981
called Yao Fei.

565
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:39,050
You have 10 seconds
to tell me where he is.

566
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,719
Purgatory.

567
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,406
Hey. He's with me.
Excuse me. He is with me.

568
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,109
Let him through.

569
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,877
You guys make sure
that perimeter is secure

570
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,579
over on the side there.

571
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,614
I thought I told you
to stand down.

572
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,583
Well, don't worry.
I left the hoodie at home.

573
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,418
Well, then what are
you doing here, John?

574
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,086
I told you I got it.

575
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,621
Then I realized

576
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,757
you're not exactly
in your right head.

577
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,292
My head is fine,
thank you.

578
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,827
Your little pep talk
really got through to me.

579
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,829
Dinah, you're
a lousy liar.

580
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,274
He didn't always
make bullets.

581
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:41,513
Vince. He used to make
this matchbox art

582
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:46,117
with a tiny, little
paper rose on the inside.

583
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:49,120
He made me one
the morning Sonos found out

584
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,022
we were undercover.

585
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:56,661
There is nothing left
of that man anymore, John.

586
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:59,097
Dinah, earlier this year when he
attacked Oliver's limo,

587
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,800
he had the chance
to kill you, and he didn't.

588
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,635
- Your point?
- My point is that maybe

589
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,905
there's something left
of the man you used to love.

590
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:09,174
If there isn't,

591
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:11,676
I'm gonna put him down,

592
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:14,779
and this time,
he'll stay dead.

593
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,281
Dinah, will you just--

594
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:19,484
You better get out of here
before Watson sees you.

595
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,290
3, 2...

596
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,691
Good evening.
I'm Jane Woods,

597
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,593
sitting tonight
with Ms. Emily Pollard.

598
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,528
Welcome,
councilwoman Pollard.

599
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,797
It's my pleasure.

600
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,302
Status?

601
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,770
Pretty quiet,
Lieutenant.

602
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:41,106
Place is locked
tight.

603
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,807
He's not getting
in here.

604
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,456
What we need is
legislation to deter

605
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,225
others from joining
this vigilante movement in the future.

606
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:58,161
We need to take
those vigilantes off the streets.

607
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,596
You don't think
they serve a role?

608
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,564
Cops serve that
role.

609
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,466
Department's been full
of corrupt cops in the past,

610
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,635
and on top of that,
we're short-handed.

611
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:08,504
All I know, Lieutenant,
is that if people

612
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:10,740
take the law
into their own hands,

613
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:13,142
we've got anarchy.

614
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:33,964
Don't move,
and it'll be quick.

615
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,734
Killing me won't
prevent the referendum from passing.

616
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:39,802
If anything, it will
make sure it does.

617
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,605
But there will be
one less corrupt politician.

618
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,176
Run!

619
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:53,049
Let's talk, Vince.
Just talk.

620
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:57,220
Freeze!
Get down on the floor!

621
00:31:57,222 --> 00:31:58,721
You have 3 seconds.

622
00:31:58,723 --> 00:31:59,922
Easy.

623
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:02,225
1...2...

624
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:03,459
Put the gun down.

625
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,894
3.

626
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:17,307
Call an ambulance.
Do it now!

627
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,490
Ugh.

628
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:38,294
How?

629
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:43,666
You're not the only one
dark matter did something to.

630
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,540
Everything heals now.

631
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,742
I thought you
were dead.

632
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,879
You let me believe it
for 4 years, Vince.

633
00:32:56,881 --> 00:33:00,583
I'm sorry. I couldn't
let myself be--

634
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:01,984
Human?

635
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,486
Distracted.

636
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,355
Distracted?
From what?

637
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:06,956
My mission.

638
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,494
We were cops
for 10 years.

639
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:14,097
What did we ever
accomplish?

640
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,765
A lot.

641
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:20,002
Not enough,
not nearly enough.

642
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:27,009
This is
the only way.

643
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:28,945
You've lost
your mind.

644
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:32,148
I'm not the only one
wearing a mask.

645
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,353
The police are coming
and the FBI.

646
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:42,792
You should go.

647
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:52,468
Black Canary,
what's happening?

648
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,370
- We're getting reports that--
- Pollard's safe. She's secure.

649
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:56,539
What about vigilante?

650
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,475
He got away.

651
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:12,677
Ugh. Ohh.

652
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,273
Hey, buddy.

653
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:43,641
I just wanted to
check in.

654
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:46,044
Is this a bad time?

655
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:48,413
It's never a bad time.

656
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:49,714
Are you coming home?

657
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:51,382
As a matter of fact,
I am.

658
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,952
Good. I wish you were
here already.

659
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:56,988
Raisa's been making me
eat granola all weekend.

660
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,823
Heh. Raisa knows
her stuff.

661
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:00,959
Granola's good for you.

662
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:03,094
Were you able to
help your friend?

663
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,801
No, I wasn't.

664
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,470
I really hope he
finds his son.

665
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:16,674
Yeah. I do, too.

666
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:18,843
Is there anything else
you can do for him?

667
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:25,083
War.

668
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,451
Who's in charge?

669
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:31,990
Unh!

670
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,437
Stop it. Stop.

671
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:59,077
Damn it, Slade. You're going to
ruin my new shoes,

672
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,546
and I just bought
them, brother.

673
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:03,881
Nylander.

674
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:07,285
This man is a legend,

675
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:10,922
so no pulling
triggers...Yet.

676
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:16,928
Truce?

677
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,663
Let me explain.

678
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,974
I knew you'd been
involved, Nylander,

679
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:32,977
but you're too stupid to run this
organization.

680
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:38,549
So where's the boss?

681
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,318
You know, I had really
hoped prison

682
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,288
would be your dead end,
but no.

683
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,260
You just had to keep
on coming, didn't you?

684
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:51,763
We've got a great
thing going here, Slade,

685
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:54,399
lots of killing,
lots of money,

686
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:58,669
and your son,
what he knows...

687
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,471
Priceless.

688
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:02,140
You like burning Bridges.

689
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:04,909
Ha ha ha!
So says the man

690
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:07,378
who nearly burnt down
a whole city.

691
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,351
You're smarter
than that, Kamrat.

692
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:26,864
Where...is my son?

693
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:30,001
Why do you ask, hmm?

694
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:34,072
Do you wish to join him?

695
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:46,818
Did you have
a good time?

696
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,020
Yeah.

697
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:51,722
Just close this up.

698
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,502
Busy night.

699
00:39:06,673 --> 00:39:10,041
Yeah. Guess we're lucky
you and your agents

700
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,976
were there to provide
backup.

701
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:13,277
Councilwoman Pollard
says she was saved

702
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:14,879
by the new Black Canary.

703
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:16,681
Hmm. Yeah,
I heard that.

704
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,683
Hell of a thing.
Pollard saved

705
00:39:18,685 --> 00:39:21,285
by one of the vigilantes
she's gunning for.

706
00:39:21,287 --> 00:39:22,887
From what I understand,

707
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,223
it didn't change
her position.

708
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:27,191
What about you?

709
00:39:28,428 --> 00:39:30,328
Try to stay out
of politics.

710
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,731
No. I mean, where
were you tonight?

711
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,266
What do you mean?
I was right there.

712
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:37,335
Not when the lights
went out.

713
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:39,103
When it went dark,
you were gone,

714
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:42,473
and the Black Canary
was there.

715
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:45,576
You think I'm
the Black Canary?

716
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:48,379
I think a lot
of things,

717
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,948
but I focus on what
I can prove.

718
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:55,887
Have a good night.

719
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:42,700
Unh!

720
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:48,105
I'm curious, Slade.

721
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:50,641
What was your plan?

722
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:53,844
Kill us all and save
your boy?

723
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:55,780
Kind of reductive, no?

724
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:57,848
I like to keep
things simple.

725
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,286
Ahh. Things rarely
are, brother.

726
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,522
Well, this is.

727
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:08,492
I will join the Jackals

728
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:12,330
as long as you let
my boy go.

729
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,971
It's like
I said.

730
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:22,473
Things aren't
so simple.

731
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,542
We need your son.

732
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,714
After all,
he's our boss.

733
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,489
Hello, father.

734
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:42,593
It's been
a long time.

736
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,067
Greg!
Move your head.
