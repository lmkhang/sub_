1
0:0:1.685 --> 0:0:6.021
he went out and joined
the Australian Intelligence Service.

2
0:0:6.023 --> 0:0:7.889
Then a week ago
in Kasnia,

3
0:0:7.891 --> 0:0:10.725
a mission
went south.

4
0:0:10.727 --> 0:0:12.227
He was dealing in arms.

5
0:0:12.229 --> 0:0:14.729
Some locals caught him.

6
0:0:14.731 --> 0:0:16.431
Supposedly, he didn't
have a fair trial,

7
0:0:16.433 --> 0:0:18.500
and now he's...

8
0:0:18.502 --> 0:0:21.002
serving a life sentence

9
0:0:21.004 --> 0:0:23.104
like a rat in a cage.

10
0:0:26.143 --> 0:0:28.343
Ok, Slade.
What do you need?

11
0:0:32.716 --> 0:0:35.517
I need you to help me
find my son.

12
0:0:35.519 --> 0:0:37.018
Last we met,
you told me

13
0:0:37.020 --> 0:0:39.220
that I couldn't live
in two worlds.

14
0:0:39.222 --> 0:0:42.524
I'm not asking you
to come back in.

15
0:0:42.526 --> 0:0:48.029
Strangely enough, what
I need is diplomacy,

16
0:0:48.031 --> 0:0:50.465
which means I don't
want Green Arrow.

17
0:0:50.467 --> 0:0:52.100
I need Oliver Queen.

18
0:0:52.102 --> 0:0:53.501
For what?

19
0:0:53.503 --> 0:0:55.136
Can I ask you
just to trust me

20
0:0:55.138 --> 0:0:57.238
on this one, kid?

21
0:0:57.240 --> 0:1:0.442
I've organized transport
to Kasnia.

22
0:1:0.444 --> 0:1:2.544
Wheels up at 2200.

23
0:1:3.780 --> 0:1:4.913
Slade: I'll understand

24
0:1:4.915 --> 0:1:6.981
if you
don't want to join me...

25
0:1:10.053 --> 0:1:13.154
But if you do,
I'll meet you out front

26
0:1:13.156 --> 0:1:16.925
at 2100, ok, kid?

27
0:1:27.304 --> 0:1:29.437
Ok. Bring the stuff over here.

28
0:1:31.308 --> 0:1:32.640
Sorry.

29
0:1:34.111 --> 0:1:37.312
Hey. Don't worry.

30
0:1:37.314 --> 0:1:40.115
It's only tent poles.

31
0:1:40.117 --> 0:1:43.084
It's not like we're gonna stick around
long enough to use them.

32
0:1:45.789 --> 0:1:47.956
Why do you say that?

33
0:1:47.958 --> 0:1:49.924
You're always leaving.

34
0:1:49.926 --> 0:1:51.893
Can't believe we
even made it this far.

35
0:1:51.895 --> 0:1:53.595
Listen. You know that I work
for Australian Airlines

36
0:1:53.597 --> 0:1:55.330
and I have to travel,

37
0:1:55.332 --> 0:1:57.499
but I promise you
this weekend

38
0:1:57.501 --> 0:1:59.801
it's just about
you and me,

39
0:1:59.803 --> 0:2:3.037
father and son
out in the wild.

40
0:2:4.441 --> 0:2:6.174
Come on. Go find
some flat land

41
0:2:6.176 --> 0:2:8.176
and pitch your tent.

42
0:2:18.355 --> 0:2:19.988
Got him. Well, I didn't
get him-get him,

43
0:2:19.990 --> 0:2:21.156
but I identified him.

44
0:2:21.158 --> 0:2:22.791
- Identified who?
- Our sniper.

45
0:2:22.793 --> 0:2:24.459
Thought your T-spheres
could track his visor.

46
0:2:24.461 --> 0:2:27.262
Well, that was then.
This is apparently now.

47
0:2:27.264 --> 0:2:29.497
He must have hacked
the tracer.

48
0:2:29.499 --> 0:2:31.132
Or got a new visor.

49
0:2:31.134 --> 0:2:33.101
It's not like they sell
them at Walmart, Felicity.

50
0:2:33.103 --> 0:2:35.036
Guys, update time.
I think our vigilante's back in town.

51
0:2:35.038 --> 0:2:36.371
He's the shooter?

52
0:2:36.373 --> 0:2:37.906
I saw him coming out
of the sniper's nest.

53
0:2:37.908 --> 0:2:40.875
CSU's here.
Don't know how much evidence

54
0:2:40.877 --> 0:2:42.510
we'll be able
to pull.

55
0:2:42.512 --> 0:2:43.878
Curtis: Well, why don't
we work with what we have,

56
0:2:43.880 --> 0:2:45.313
mainly the vigilante
seemed to be targeting

57
0:2:45.315 --> 0:2:46.614
councilwoman Pollard.

58
0:2:46.616 --> 0:2:48.216
"Seemed to be" being
the operative word.

59
0:2:48.218 --> 0:2:49.484
Well, Pollard's the one
who's championing

60
0:2:49.486 --> 0:2:51.352
the anti-vigilante bill.

61
0:2:51.354 --> 0:2:52.887
Seems like a guy named
vigilante wouldn't like her much.

62
0:2:52.889 --> 0:2:54.689
John: Yeah, but martyr her?
That would get this bill

63
0:2:54.691 --> 0:2:56.858
passed faster than you
could say "obstruction."

64
0:2:56.860 --> 0:2:58.359
Dinah: If it passes,
I'm gonna have to consider

65
0:2:58.361 --> 0:3:0.161
arresting myself.
