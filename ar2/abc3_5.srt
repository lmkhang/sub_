1
0:0:0.390 --> 0:0:3.057
with a strong
magnetic field.

2
0:0:7.130 --> 0:0:8.996
You think it's something
you can trace?

3
0:0:8.998 --> 0:0:10.698
I like your optimism.

4
0:0:10.700 --> 0:0:12.433
It's not optimism,
Felicity.

5
0:0:12.435 --> 0:0:14.035
It's faith.

6
0:0:15.138 --> 0:0:17.104
Dinah said that you
had a chat

7
0:0:17.106 --> 0:0:18.506
with our FBI BFF.

8
0:0:18.508 --> 0:0:20.842
Oh, yes.
She was tough,

9
0:0:20.844 --> 0:0:22.343
but I pushed back
pretty hard.

10
0:0:22.345 --> 0:0:23.711
Think we put
that to bed.

11
0:0:23.713 --> 0:0:24.879
Good.

12
0:0:24.881 --> 0:0:26.581
[Cell phone
vibrates and rings]

13
0:0:26.583 --> 0:0:29.183
Hello?

14
0:0:29.185 --> 0:0:31.385
Special agent Watson.

15
0:0:31.387 --> 0:0:34.555
Yes. Sure. I can come by tomorrow.
No problem.

16
0:0:34.557 --> 0:0:36.691
All right.
See you then.

17
0:0:36.693 --> 0:0:38.626
Definitely not
put to bed.

18
0:0:40.630 --> 0:0:42.864
So where's your
point of contact?

19
0:0:42.866 --> 0:0:46.067
I don't know.
His name's Nylander.

20
0:0:46.069 --> 0:0:49.070
Foreign associate of mine from back
in the service days.

21
0:0:49.072 --> 0:0:51.706
He's a bit of a jackass
and never on time.

22
0:0:51.708 --> 0:0:54.675
Man: He's not
that bad.

23
0:0:54.677 --> 0:0:58.946
Ha ha! Slade Wilson,
the Terminator.

24
0:0:58.948 --> 0:1:1.649
I haven't heard
that name in a while.

25
0:1:1.651 --> 0:1:3.618
See you're running
later than usual.

26
0:1:3.620 --> 0:1:4.886
Yeah. I was
with a girl.

27
0:1:4.888 --> 0:1:7.288
Forget about it.
Look at you.

28
0:1:7.290 --> 0:1:10.057
Mirakuru did
you wonders, huh?

29
0:1:10.059 --> 0:1:11.425
Oh, what? You're
not sensitive

30
0:1:11.427 --> 0:1:13.694
about that skit,
are you?

31
0:1:13.696 --> 0:1:16.297
You were quite
the madman, I hear.

32
0:1:16.299 --> 0:1:18.733
You promised me something.
Did you bring it,

33
0:1:18.735 --> 0:1:21.669
or did I waste my time
traveling 7,000 miles

34
0:1:21.671 --> 0:1:23.271
for you to screw with me?

35
0:1:23.273 --> 0:1:25.506
Truth be told,

36
0:1:25.508 --> 0:1:27.842
I'm glad you got
your marbles back.

37
0:1:30.847 --> 0:1:32.513
So who's this?

38
0:1:32.515 --> 0:1:34.982
He's a friend of mine.
Don't worry about him.

39
0:1:34.984 --> 0:1:38.019
With you,
I always worry.

40
0:1:38.021 --> 0:1:41.489
This should work. Thank you.

41
0:1:41.491 --> 0:1:42.957
That's it?
Just "thank you"?

42
0:1:42.959 --> 0:1:45.359
No extravagant
dinner, no pints?

43
0:1:45.361 --> 0:1:47.862
Maybe next time
when my son isn't rotting

44
0:1:47.864 --> 0:1:50.131
in a third-world prison.

45
0:1:50.133 --> 0:1:53.000
He's lucky to have
you as a father.

46
0:1:53.002 --> 0:1:54.735
My son wouldn't be
in this mess

47
0:1:54.737 --> 0:1:57.838
if anybody else was
his father.

48
0:1:57.840 --> 0:1:59.607
Just be careful,
Kamrat.

49
0:1:59.609 --> 0:2:2.944
Your boy was snooping
around some private-op mercenaries,

50
0:2:2.946 --> 0:2:5.212
um, not so nice
guys.

51
0:2:8.117 --> 0:2:10.885
Under certain circumstances,

52
0:2:10.887 --> 0:2:12.520
I'm not so nice a guy.

53
0:2:19.963 --> 0:2:22.697
Eh. Not so big
into decoration, are you?

54
0:2:22.699 --> 0:2:25.132
I'm less enthusiastic
for people wasting my time.

55
0:2:25.134 --> 0:2:26.500
Ok.

56
0:2:26.502 --> 0:2:27.868
You're seeing
Oliver Queen again.

57
0:2:27.870 --> 0:2:29.470
Yeah. These new
prescription glasses

58
0:2:29.472 --> 0:2:32.573
are really working
wonders. Heh heh.

59
0:2:32.575 --> 0:2:34.342
It was just a little...

60
0:2:34.344 --> 0:2:36.944
FBI interrogation
humor, you know?

61
0:2:36.946 --> 0:2:38.879
Your Mr. Queen's alibi
for certain evenings

62
0:2:38.881 --> 0:2:40.181
where the Green Arrow
was active.

63
0:2:40.183 --> 0:2:41.749
If you say so.

64
0:2:41.751 --> 0:2:43.751
My point is are you
prepared to testify under oath

65
0:2:43.753 --> 0:2:45.319
under the pains
and penalties of perjury

66
0:2:45.321 --> 0:2:47.154
in support
of those alibis?

67
0:2:47.156 --> 0:2:49.023
Yeah, absolutely.

68
0:2:49.025 --> 0:2:51.492
100%. Super-ready.

69
0:2:51.494 --> 0:2:53.060
[Cell phone chimes
and vibrates]

70
0:2:57.300 --> 0:2:59.166
Everything
all right?

71
0:2:59.168 --> 0:3:1.268
Mm-hmm.
