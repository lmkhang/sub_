1
0:0:1.498 --> 0:0:5.467
Samanda: Excuse me.
What are you doing here?

2
0:0:5.469 --> 0:0:7.168
You're not SCPD.

3
0:0:7.170 --> 0:0:9.671
Dinah: No, he's not,
and this is not a federal case.

4
0:0:9.673 --> 0:0:11.139
Still doesn't explain
what John Diggle,

5
0:0:11.141 --> 0:0:12.907
who works personal security
for the mayor,

6
0:0:12.909 --> 0:0:14.476
is doing
at a crime scene.

7
0:0:14.478 --> 0:0:16.144
I have relevant
experience,

8
0:0:16.146 --> 0:0:18.813
and the mayor thought
this could use a fresh set of eyes.

9
0:0:18.815 --> 0:0:21.516
What type
of experience?

10
0:0:21.518 --> 0:0:23.318
Sniper.

11
0:0:23.320 --> 0:0:25.753
I don't recall reading that in
your military file.

12
0:0:25.755 --> 0:0:27.255
I'm sorry.
Tell me again why

13
0:0:27.257 --> 0:0:28.957
you're reviewing
my service jacket.

14
0:0:28.959 --> 0:0:30.825
Mayor Queen didn't
mention he was under investigation.

15
0:0:30.827 --> 0:0:32.760
Of course he did.
It has nothing to do with that.

16
0:0:32.762 --> 0:0:33.928
But you've been
working with him

17
0:0:33.930 --> 0:0:35.430
for the past
6 years,

18
0:0:35.432 --> 0:0:37.699
which makes us
overdo for a chat.

19
0:0:39.102 --> 0:0:41.236
I could wait for
a subpoena if you'd prefer.

20
0:0:41.238 --> 0:0:43.204
No. I'm an open book.

21
0:0:43.206 --> 0:0:46.107
Step into my office.

22
0:0:46.109 --> 0:0:49.577
Uh-uh! Private
conversation.

23
0:0:54.985 --> 0:0:56.417
Hey, William.

24
0:0:56.419 --> 0:0:58.753
Hi.

25
0:0:58.755 --> 0:1:1.556
How are those quadratic
equations going?

26
0:1:1.558 --> 0:1:2.857
I hate them.

27
0:1:2.859 --> 0:1:4.859
Yeah. Those were
the days.

28
0:1:4.861 --> 0:1:6.427
Where's your dad?

29
0:1:6.429 --> 0:1:8.129
In his room.

30
0:1:11.034 --> 0:1:13.535
Ah. Do you remember
when our biggest problem in life

31
0:1:13.537 --> 0:1:15.370
was solving
a quadratic equation?

32
0:1:15.372 --> 0:1:19.941
Uh-uh. I mean, I never really worried
about them, but no.

33
0:1:19.943 --> 0:1:24.913
Well, now we have metas
crashing bachelorette parties, so--wow.

34
0:1:24.915 --> 0:1:27.982
Slade invited you
on a romantic getaway?

35
0:1:27.984 --> 0:1:29.651
- Something like that.
- Where?

36
0:1:29.653 --> 0:1:31.619
Don't say Aruba.
That's our spot.

37
0:1:31.621 --> 0:1:33.121
Kasnia.

38
0:1:33.123 --> 0:1:34.422
Wow!

39
0:1:34.424 --> 0:1:36.691
His son is
in some trouble.

40
0:1:36.693 --> 0:1:38.826
The kind of trouble you need
to get in more trouble to fix it?

41
0:1:38.828 --> 0:1:42.463
Well, Slade says that
he has a diplomatic solution

42
0:1:42.465 --> 0:1:45.533
that requires my name
and not me in a mask.

43
0:1:45.535 --> 0:1:46.935
I'm worried that
if I don't go,

44
0:1:46.937 --> 0:1:49.571
he'll take a more
aggressive approach.

45
0:1:49.573 --> 0:1:52.206
So the empty bag,
is that second thoughts

46
0:1:52.208 --> 0:1:55.376
or can't decide what
t-shirt to pack?

47
0:1:57.013 --> 0:1:59.013
Because I'm out.

48
0:1:59.015 --> 0:2:0.515
I made a promise
to my son,

49
0:2:0.517 --> 0:2:2.250
and I'm out.

50
0:2:2.252 --> 0:2:4.485
It sounds like you
made a promise to Slade, too.

51
0:2:4.487 --> 0:2:6.321
You think I should go?

52
0:2:6.323 --> 0:2:9.190
It's not like you're
going back to your old life.

53
0:2:9.192 --> 0:2:11.292
I wanted you to tell me
not to go.

54
0:2:11.294 --> 0:2:13.328
Look. Slade is not
my favorite person,

55
0:2:13.330 --> 0:2:17.031
but, I mean, it's not
about Slade.

56
0:2:18.568 --> 0:2:21.235
- It's about his son.
- Yeah.

57
0:2:21.237 --> 0:2:23.271
If you don't go, you're just gonna beat
yourself up about it.

58
0:2:23.273 --> 0:2:25.273
If--when it veers
from diplomacy

59
0:2:25.275 --> 0:2:26.941
and I have to break
my promise to William,

60
0:2:26.943 --> 0:2:29.644
I will beat myself up
over that, too.

61
0:2:29.646 --> 0:2:30.778
Don't tell William
what you're doing.

62
0:2:30.780 --> 0:2:32.847
- What?
- Spare him the details

63
0:2:32.849 --> 0:2:35.850
of, you know,
Slade being...Slade

64
0:2:35.852 --> 0:2:39.253
and tell him that
you're helping a friend.

65
0:2:39.255 --> 0:2:41.923
He'll understand that.

66
0:2:41.925 --> 0:2:44.926
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

67
0:2:44.928 --> 0:2:46.761
He's his father's son.
