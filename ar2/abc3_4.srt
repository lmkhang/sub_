1
0:0:8.585 --> 0:0:10.351
How long's
this flight?

2
0:0:13.790 --> 0:0:15.623
It's about 12 hours.

3
0:0:17.060 --> 0:0:19.761
Thanks for coming, kid.

4
0:0:19.763 --> 0:0:21.596
Let's go get your boy.

5
0:0:25.435 --> 0:0:26.868
[Beep]

6
0:0:42.152 --> 0:0:43.651
SCPD!

7
0:0:48.058 --> 0:0:49.390
Hey!

8
0:0:51.961 --> 0:0:54.395
[Canary cry]

9
0:0:58.835 --> 0:1:0.268
Stay down.

10
0:1:12.649 --> 0:1:14.315
It's you.

11
0:1:30.100 --> 0:1:32.867
Got your 911.
Is everything ok?

12
0:1:32.869 --> 0:1:36.337
Curtis: Look at her face.
That is not an ok face.

13
0:1:37.907 --> 0:1:39.674
Dinah?

14
0:1:40.910 --> 0:1:42.310
Vigilante
made another move

15
0:1:42.312 --> 0:1:45.079
on councilwoman Pollard
tonight.

16
0:1:45.081 --> 0:1:46.948
I almost got him.

17
0:1:46.950 --> 0:1:48.750
Rene: It's cool, D.

18
0:1:48.752 --> 0:1:50.918
We'll nail that bastard.

19
0:1:50.920 --> 0:1:53.321
I hit him
with my cry.

20
0:1:53.323 --> 0:1:55.089
I shattered
his visor,

21
0:1:55.091 --> 0:1:56.924
and he--he took off
his mask.

22
0:1:59.162 --> 0:2:0.962
I saw his face.

23
0:2:0.964 --> 0:2:2.563
Can you I.D. him?

24
0:2:2.565 --> 0:2:5.099
His name is
Vincent Sobel.

25
0:2:7.270 --> 0:2:9.303
He's my old partner.

26
0:2:9.305 --> 0:2:11.139
Curtis: I'm sorry.
When you say partner,

27
0:2:11.141 --> 0:2:14.041
do you mean partner,
or do you mean "partner"?

28
0:2:14.043 --> 0:2:16.577
- Both.
- Now I'm confused.

29
0:2:16.579 --> 0:2:18.379
Dinah, I thought you said
your partner died in the line.

30
0:2:18.381 --> 0:2:22.450
He was shot in the head right
in front of me.

31
0:2:22.452 --> 0:2:24.452
[Gunshot]

32
0:2:24.454 --> 0:2:26.854
[Dinah screaming]

33
0:2:29.559 --> 0:2:32.960
[Canary cry]

34
0:2:32.962 --> 0:2:35.830
Ok. Well, I know you believe you saw
what you saw tonight,

35
0:2:35.832 --> 0:2:38.800
but it was night
and probably dark.

36
0:2:38.802 --> 0:2:41.469
It was him,
Felicity.

37
0:2:41.471 --> 0:2:44.472
It was Vincent.
I know it.

38
0:2:44.474 --> 0:2:46.007
I know it sounds
crazy.

39
0:2:46.009 --> 0:2:48.476
John: Dinah, this doesn't
change anything.

40
0:2:48.478 --> 0:2:50.845
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

41
0:2:50.847 --> 0:2:53.147
Yeah, I know.
I know.

42
0:2:53.149 --> 0:2:54.348
Where are you
with, the, uh,

43
0:2:54.350 --> 0:2:55.817
shell casing
John found?

44
0:2:55.819 --> 0:2:57.785
The casing appears
to be magnetized.

45
0:2:57.787 --> 0:2:59.153
- Bullets aren't magnetic.
- They can be if they're

46
0:2:59.155 --> 0:3:0.388
stored in an environment
