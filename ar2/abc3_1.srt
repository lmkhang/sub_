Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
0:0:2.067 --> 0:0:4.174
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
0:0:4.175 --> 0:0:6.676
with only one goal--
to save my city,

4
0:0:6.677 --> 0:0:8.443
but I couldn't honor that
commitment

5
0:0:8.445 --> 0:0:11.546
and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son,

6
0:0:11.548 --> 0:0:13.682
so I asked the best man I know
to help.

7
0:0:13.684 --> 0:0:15.250
His name is John Diggle,

8
0:0:15.252 --> 0:0:18.887
and he is the Green Arrow.

Previously on "Arrow"...

Quentin: Pollard--
she's using last night's disaster

11
0:0:22.693 --> 0:0:24.126
as a pretext to
introduce her

12
0:0:24.128 --> 0:0:26.862
anti-vigilante legislation
to the council.

13
0:0:26.864 --> 0:0:29.564
I am invoking chapter 9
of the city charter.

14
0:0:29.566 --> 0:0:31.666
That will convert
councilwoman Pollard's bill

15
0:0:31.668 --> 0:0:33.568
to a citywide
referendum.

16
0:0:33.570 --> 0:0:34.736
What do you want?

17
0:0:34.738 --> 0:0:36.738
To operate
without interference.

18
0:0:36.740 --> 0:0:38.740
So you can keep
killing people?

19
0:0:38.742 --> 0:0:40.842
You don't seem to know
that this is a war.

20
0:0:40.844 --> 0:0:44.079
The Intel that you
gave me on my son Joe panned out,

21
0:0:44.081 --> 0:0:45.847
so I'm heading
to Calgary.

22
0:0:45.849 --> 0:0:47.182
Good luck, Slade.

23
0:1:0.831 --> 0:1:2.597
Dinah: Ms. Pollard.

24
0:1:2.599 --> 0:1:5.100
Captain wanted you to
see the latest CompStat.

Thanks, Lieutenant.

Well, I'm just glad
no one was seriously hurt.

36
0:1:45.576 --> 0:1:47.242
How do you want
to handle this?

37
0:1:47.244 --> 0:1:49.077
I'd like you to
issue a statement on my behalf.

38
0:1:49.079 --> 0:1:50.212
On your behalf?

39
0:1:50.214 --> 0:1:52.147
I have an old friend
in town

40
0:1:52.149 --> 0:1:54.382
that needs my help,
and I might not be back

41
0:1:54.384 --> 0:1:56.084
in the office
for a few hours.

42
0:1:56.086 --> 0:1:58.019
Do we have any idea
who the shooter was targeting?

43
0:1:58.021 --> 0:1:59.254
We're working on it.

44
0:1:59.256 --> 0:2:2.357
Good. Um, be the mayor
until I get back.

45
0:2:2.359 --> 0:2:3.725
For real?

46
0:2:3.727 --> 0:2:5.694
No. It's
a figure of speech,

47
0:2:5.696 --> 0:2:8.797
but j--just don't make any laws
while I'm out of the office, ok?

48
0:2:8.799 --> 0:2:10.665
Fine.

49
0:2:10.667 --> 0:2:12.867
And don't worry
about the shooter.

50
0:2:12.869 --> 0:2:14.369
We're gonna nail
his ass.

51
0:2:14.371 --> 0:2:15.837
I know you will.

52
0:2:18.275 --> 0:2:21.710
Sorry.
That was work.

53
0:2:21.712 --> 0:2:23.845
Slade: Don't apologize.

54
0:2:23.847 --> 0:2:26.047
I appreciate
the meeting.

55
0:2:26.049 --> 0:2:28.250
You helped me find my son.

56
0:2:28.252 --> 0:2:30.151
Least I can is help
you find Joe.

57
0:2:30.153 --> 0:2:32.821
He doesn't go
by that name anymore.

58
0:2:32.823 --> 0:2:34.356
Changed his name?

59
0:2:34.358 --> 0:2:36.725
It was his
mother's idea.

60
0:2:36.727 --> 0:2:39.160
Her maiden name.

61
0:2:39.162 --> 0:2:41.696
He goes by Kane now.

62
0:2:41.698 --> 0:2:43.198
What happened
to him?

63
0:2:43.200 --> 0:2:45.267
I tracked him
to Calgary,

64
0:2:45.269 --> 0:2:48.103
but by then, he'd gone,

65
0:2:48.105 --> 0:2:51.206
so I followed him
to Ibiza--heh--

66
0:2:51.208 --> 0:2:53.174
and then Mombassa.

67
0:2:53.176 --> 0:2:54.876
Mombassa?

68
0:2:56.713 --> 0:2:59.881
The kid took
after his father.
