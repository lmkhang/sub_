2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:04,321
[Toni] You wanna get through this?
Hang with the Serpents.

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,032
You think you can come to my house
and there wouldn't be payback?

4
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:09,993
[Alice] I'm wondering
when you're gonna actually address

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,621
the real problem in Riverdale,
the Southside.

6
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:16,458
[Fred] We need to be united.
If we let the fear take over, we're dead.

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,418
I want a more active role
in Lodge Industries.

8
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,712
Of course. You're a Lodge, after all.

9
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:23,840
- Everybody needs to leave.
- The Black Hood is coming.

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,386
This is from the Black Hood.
He says he's doing it for me.

11
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,930
- Hello?
- [man] <i>Hello, Betty.</i>

12
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:32,975
<i>This is the Black Hood speaking.</i>

13
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:34,518
How...?

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,313
How do I know this is real?

15
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:42,359
- <i>"I will strike next where it all began."</i>
- Were you there?

16
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,153
- At the Town Hall?
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>

17
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,364
But you didn't hurt anyone?

18
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,033
<i>Tonight was all about you.</i>

19
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,451
What do you want?

20
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:52,995
<i>The same as you.</i>

21
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:56,164
<i>To set Riverdale
on the righteous path again.</i>

22
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:58,208
<i>To cleanse it of sinners.</i>

23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,962
- <i>Isn't that what you want?</i>
- Not by killing people.

24
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,714
<i>Only the ones who deserve it.</i>

25
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,258
<i>People like your sister.</i>

26
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,595
<i>I know about
the sin she carries in her womb.</i>

27
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,683
<i>I also know she's at a farm
two hours north.</i>

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,519
<i>If you try to warn her, I'll know.</i>

29
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:22,190
<i>If you tell the police we've spoken
or your mystery-loving boyfriend,</i>

30
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,401
<i>I'll carve her like a jack-o'-lantern.</i>

31
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,570
Please, don't hurt her.

32
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:30,907
- Who are you talking to? It's late.
- <i>Then don't you deny me.</i>

33
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,994
- It's Jughead, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,455
I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

35
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:40,042
Now he's living on the Southside
amongst criminals and degenerates.

36
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:44,504
He's showing his true colors. No doubt
inspiring your stunt at Town Hall.

37
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,716
- Pulling the fire alarm?
- I didn't know what else to do.

38
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,510
Given the letter the Black Hood sent.

39
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:54,556
If he even wrote it.
Sheriff Keller says something seems off.

40
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:57,351
He's gonna have it analyzed
with the one I got.

41
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:01,396
In the meantime, I want you home
straight after school. Are we clear?

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,190
Yeah. Sorry, Mom.

43
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,778
[Archie] I did what Weatherbee asked.
Wrote an apology

44
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,530
and posted a new video
apologizing some more.

45
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,785
So, this, uh, Red Circle business,
it's over?

46
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,579
I'm happy to hear it.

47
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,959
I've been missing my son.

48
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,090
[phone chimes]

49
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,849
I need to tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone else.

50
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:41,895
Not Veronica, not Jughead, not your dad.
Just no one. You promise me?

51
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:43,730
Yeah, sure. I promise.

52
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,524
The Black Hood called me.

53
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:49,402
- What?
- No, keep walking.

54
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,781
Wait. The Black Hood called you?

55
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:56,576
Yes, it's risky for me to be telling you,
but we're best friends.

56
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,746
We live right next door.
Us walking to school together

57
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,041
would look normal
to anyone watching, including him.

58
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,253
- You think he's watching us?
- He could be.

59
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:10,715
- I know it sounds crazy, but it was him.
- Tell the police, even if it's not him.

60
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,261
It is him. He told me if I went
to the police or told Jughead...

61
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,597
God, he knows where Polly is, Arch.

62
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,268
- If he calls, I have to answer.
- I won't let you go through this alone.

63
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:29,609
"This most recent incident confirms
that the real threat is not the Black Hood

64
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,446
but the Southside

65
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,740

doesn't want to fix our problems,
merely profit from them."

69
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,044
Right before our open house.
Thank you, Alice Cooper.

70
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,215
We can't let anything derail this project.

71
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,760
Not Alice, not the Southside gangs,
not some hooded psychopath.

72
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,555
Well, right now,
our biggest problem is capital.

73
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,557
We're running out of it and fast.

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,644
I've invited investors to the open house.
The St. Clairs from New York.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,231
Wait. They are? Nicky included?

76
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,026
I haven't seen Nicky in forever.

77
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,573
Yeah, he's a budding music producer now.

78
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,493
And his father is King Midas rich.

79
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,870
We get him to invest, others will follow.

80
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,705
You wanted a seat at the table.

81
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,874
Nick has his father's ear.

82
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,834
Help us close this.

83
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,795
Show him all the good things
Riverdale has to offer.

84
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:32,756
With pleasure.

- Nice article your girlfriend's mom wrote.
- I saw that.

88
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,268
Dilton Doiley was stabbed
and you jumped him?

89
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,812
The idiot stabbed himself
with his own knife.

90
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,065
[Sweet Pea] We didn't jump him.
There was a fight.

91
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,108
Bulldogs versus Serpents. See this?

92
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,780
Andrews gave it to me before
his girlfriend shot a gun into the air.

93
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,199
- What happened?
- And, of course,

94
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,953
Northsiders get off scot-free,
the rest of us are hauled in by police.

95
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,289
- It's payback time.
- What are you guys talking about?

96
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,793
What is...? What is that?

97
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:13,255
Is that a pipe bomb?

98
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,217
Fogarty's cousin served in the Army.
He's gonna build us something.

99
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,930
We'll do it after hours.
It'll shut the <i>Riverdale Register</i> down.

100
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,432
You think blowing up
a building will make things better?

101
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,936
- Can't get any worse.
- Yeah, Sweet Pea, it can.

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,984
- Let me talk to Archie, figure this out.
- That's your answer for everything. Talk.

103
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,486
We don't know who you stand with.

104
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,947
Us? Or them?

105
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:45,036
You can't be half a Serpent.

106
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,506
Great. So, Archie started World War III.

107
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,426
Northside has been
dumping on us for years.

108
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,095
Your dad tried to keep the peace.

109
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,014
Avoid bloodshed.

110
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,393
Now that he's gone, idiots like Sweet Pea
think there's one path and solution.

111
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,562
Violence.

112
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,403
Nick and I were the
"will-they-or-won't-they" of our jet set.

113
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:21,197
He's an outrageous flirt,
but we never dated.

114
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,743
We'd hop from club to club,
go on these madcap adventures,

115
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,910
stay up all night.

116
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,039
- Who's this now?
- Oh, Archiekins, don't be jelly.

117
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,208
It's just a ghost
from my bad-girl past, Nick St. Clair,

You have nothing to worry about.

119

I think this Northsider's lost.

120
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:53,897
I'm not.

121
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,233
I'm over being half a Serpent.

122

Wow. You'll do anything to protect
your Northside buddies.

123
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,659
My father was a Serpent.

124
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,410
He led you.

125

I wanna stand with you guys.

126

Tall Boy was the one
who gave me this jacket.

It's finally time I start wearing it.

128
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,428
So, now you wanna be a Serpent, huh?

00:40:58,382 --> 00:40:59,467
What's that?

685
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,762
<i>The fact that you've been telling Archie
about our chats.</i>

686
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:06,349
<i>Betty, I've been watching you.</i>

687
00:41:06,724 --> 00:41:10,186
- You never said I couldn't tell Archie.
- <i>You broke the rules.</i>

688
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:14,148
- <i>And now your sister will pay.</i>
- Please, don't hurt her.

689
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:15,900
<i>Then give me another name.</i>

690
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:17,860
- <i>Right now.</i>
- What?

691
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:21,197
<i>If you wanna save your sister,
give me another name.</i>

692
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,823
<i>The name of someone guilty.</i>

693
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,534
<i>Come on, Betty. One little name.</i>

694
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:27,787
I won't. I can't do that.

695
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,456
<i>Then I'll kill your sister,
and your mother,</i>

696
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:33,584
<i>and your father,
and everyone you hold dear.</i>

697
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,504
Nick St. Clair.

698
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,883
He's staying at the Five Seasons.

699
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:46,097
<i>I told you, we were the same.</i>
