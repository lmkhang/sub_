It's evidence.

170
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:39,116
Kevin, if we give this
letter to your dad,

171
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,187
he will tell my mom, and she will
make damn sure I'm nowhere near this.

172
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,822
- Good.
- No.

173
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,559
This is a test.

174
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:51,069
He said so himself. What if...

175
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:54,647
The start of the test
is to see what I do

176
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,662
with the letter? Do I share it? Or not?

177
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,364
Am I strong?

178
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,139
Or am I weak? Am I... Worthy?

179

He's a psychopath, Betty, and you
are in high school, not the FBI.

180
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:10,138
Isn't it better for people to be focusing
on the cipher, rather than the letter?

181
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,574
How would that even happen?

182
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,608
Mom, I'm so scared.

183
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,226
I didn't know what to do or who to call.

184
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:26,139
Oh, baby, please tell me what's
going on so I can make it better.

185
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,866
I got this envelope at the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

186
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,635
Not another letter from the Black Hood.

187
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,637
No, not a letter.

188
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,986
Was there anything else
in the envelope? A note?

189
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:41,567
Not according to Betty.

190
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,725
Why a code this time,
and not another letter?

191
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,638
And why did he send it to
your daughter and not you?

192
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,754
Well, it's obvious, Sheriff.

193
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,788
He needs a platform to grandstand on,

194
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,224
and he's terrified of me.

195
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:58,468
Well, there's a cryptologist over in
Centerville. I'll get it over to him.

00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,633
- In the meantime...
- I've already published it, Sheriff.

197

trying to crack this code.

have made that video.

What if he comes after us next?

turf, the Southside.

[ARCHIE] No, I've gone over this.

215
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:52,469
Mrs. Cooper is convinced the Black Hood
is a Southsider with an axe to grind,

216
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,071
which makes sense when you think
about the people he's attacked

217
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,547
My dad. A Northsider.

218
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,957

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,328

- Yeah, But before that, she taught here, Doiley.

Everyone has seen our video
and is riled up as hell, right?

221
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,110
We can only assume
the Black Hood is, too.

222
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:11,768
If there's even a chance that
he's a Southsider, us going there

223
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,306

presence known, could draw him out.

224

I know you have a certain
item in your possession.

way to draw the Black Hood out.

honest. Why do you ask?

how earnest he is.

an innocent sort of way.
