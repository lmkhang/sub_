[Jughead] <i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:04,460
If we don't face the reality
of who and what we are,

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,864
then what happened to
Jason could happen again.

4
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:08,731
Or, God forbid, something even worse.

5
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,098
"Thanks for trying. I'm going
to be with Jason now..."

6
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,767
Where would Cheryl go to be with Jason?

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,312
- [Veronica] No!
- Cheryl!

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,953
- [Cheryl coughing]
- [Veronica] Cheryl!

9
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,955
It's the only way we can
truly start over, be purified.

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,147
Your father's facing serious jail time.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,351
Your mom's over-extended
and out of state.

[Tall Boy] <i>Serpents take

- Juggy?

14
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,216
He's moving in with a foster family.

15
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,692
Why are you trying to
push Fred out of this deal?

16
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,395
Your father is coming back.

17
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,162
He and Fred, they will not get along.

18
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:38,897
I'm not selling, Hermione.

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,699

supposed to change everything.</i>

23
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,482
<i>Be a new start.</i>

24
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,184
<i>But when we woke up the next morning,</i>

25
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:03,807
<i>Riverdale was still, at
its heart, a haunted town.</i>

26
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:09,995
<i>Meanwhile, Archie Andrews, who doesn't
even have a driver's license yet,</i>

27
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,800

down the streets of Riverdale,</i>

28

- <i>trying to outrace death.</i>
- [Fred groaning]

29
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:19,545
[Archie] Hold on, Dad, hold on.

30
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:22,674
Hold on, Dad. We're almost there.

31
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,281
We're almost there.
They're gonna fix you up.

32
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,778
Stay with me, Dad, stay with me.

[Jughead] <i>Now, I don't believe
in miracles, usually,</i>

34
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,954
<i>but it was a miracle that Archie
got his dad to Riverdale General</i>

35
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,256
<i>without wrecking the truck.</i>

36
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,491
[Archie] Help, please.

37
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:42,694
Help, hey! Someone help me and my dad.

38
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,797
- [nurse] Gurney!
- [Doctor] What happened to him?

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,664
[Archie] He was... He was shot.

40
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,333
[indistinct chatter]

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,038
[nurse] Sir, can you hear me?

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,262
- Can you tell me your name?
- His name's Fred Andrews.

43
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:58,377
- [speaking indistinctly]
- [nurse] He's not responding.

44
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,739
- Massive blood loss, it looks...
- Let's go. He's in shock.

45
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,788
Sir, I'm sorry, I need you to step away.

46
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,192
One, two, three!

47
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,627
[EKG beeping]

48
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:22,401
I'm right here, Dad,
I'm right here. Okay.

49
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,003
I'm right here.

50
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,305
I'm right here.

51
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,373
Dad? What gives? Take the picture.

52
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,577
The ceremony starts in
the gym in ten minutes.

53
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,211
Yeah, Dad, what's taking so long?

54
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,745
I... [sighs]

55
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:36,977
Just can't believe we're here, Archie.

56
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,251
We're at your graduation. I... [chuckles]

57
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,019
I didn't think I'd live to see this day.

58
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,375
[echoing] Yeah, except
you didn't, Mr. A.

59
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,577
What?

60
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,234
You didn't live to see this day.

61
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,403
Don't you remember? At Pop's?

[Alice] <i>Good morning, sweetheart.</i>

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,184
So, what did you and your
friends do after the Jubilee?

68
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,819
We went to Pop's.

69
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:17,823
And then, Jughead and I
went back to FP's trailer.

70
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,760
Oh, Betty.

71
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:25,051
If that beanie-wearing cad defiled you,

72
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,923
at least please tell
me that you were safe.

73
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

74
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:31,203
No, Mom, we didn't. I mean...

75
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:34,405
We almost did, but then
we were interrupted...

76
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,897
- Well, thank God.
- By the Southside Serpents.

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,744
- Excuse me? By those thugs?
- [clears throat]

78
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:43,115
Oh. See, I knew that Jughead was gonna
follow in FP's criminal footsteps.

79
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:45,450
[scoffs] The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree,

80
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,027
especially not when there's a
snake curled up in its limbs.

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,354
[cell phone ringing]

82
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,217
If that's Snake Plissken,
I want him blocked.

83
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,886
- It's Archie.
- Block him too.

84
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,660
Hey.

85
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,022
What is that?

86
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,101
A chocolate almond croissant

87
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,703
from Bean & Beluga.

88
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,497
Unfortunately, I only have the one.

89
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,049
The other thing, Veronica.

90
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, this. A mimosa.

91
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,031
There was a bottle of champagne in
the fridge just begging to be popped.

92
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,622
Okay, that was a bottle
of Cristal for your father.

93
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,338
[cell phone ringing]

94
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,617
Sorry, I have to take this.

95
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,258
If that's your house
guest from last night...

96
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,187
It's Betty. Hello?

97
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,491
- [cell phone rings]
- Hey, Betty.

98
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,270
[engine revving]

99
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,025
[Betty] Arch?

100
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,360
God.

101
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,161
I came out of the bathroom and there was

102
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,984
this man, thief...

103
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,775
Wearing this hood,
with a gun on Pop Tate,

104
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,614
and then he pointed it
at my dad and he fired.

105
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,637
- [Veronica] Oh, my God, Archie.
- And then he...

106
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:30,822
And then he what?

107
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,424
And then he bolted.

108
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:34,960
Then I was holding my dad,

109
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:38,630
Pop Tate called an ambulance and it
didn't come so I drove here and... [sighs]

110
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,607
And I don't know, maybe I should've
waited, maybe I made it worse...

111
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,402
No, dude, are you kidding me?

112
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:45,437
You saved your dad's life.

113
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,360
First Cheryl, and now your dad.

114
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,763
If you keep this up, you're
gonna need a superhero name.

115
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,828
Like Pureheart the Powerful.

116
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:55,399
There isn't any new information.
Your dad's in surgery.

117
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,482
He's gonna be there for a while.

118
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,476
Uh, Archie. Have you spoken to
your mother about any of this yet?

119
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,015
No. No, I haven't called her.

120
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,484
I'll be right back.

121
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,428
[sighs]

122
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,332
- What?
- [Betty] Mom.

123
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,600
Do not start this.

124
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,756
Start what?

125
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,670
Well, of course, I can't help but wonder

126
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,439
if your Southside associates

127
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,448
had anything to do with
what happened to Fred.

128
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,176
- Alice, relax.
- [Jughead] Unbelievable.

129
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:27,696
At least you can't accuse my father of
being the shooter, considering he's in jail.

130
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,266
Oh, my God, I can't handle this.

131
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,851
[sighs]

132
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,687
[Archie] Hey, Mom, how are you?

133
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,092
Good, yeah, good. We're, uh... We...

134
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,129
[clicks tongue]

135
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:46,698
Actually, Mom, we're not,
we're in trouble here.

136
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,620
[inhales deeply] Dad's in the hospital.

137
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,904
It was a robbery,

138
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,932
and, uh, he was shot.

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,542
[sniffling]

140
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,111
I don't know what's gonna happen, Mom,

141
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:01,880
but I think you should come here
as soon as you can, in case...

142
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,151
In case we have to say goodbye.

143

- How's your dad doing?

145
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,119
- He's still in surgery.
- [Archie sighs]

146
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,956
Archie, I know this is a
hell of a time for you, but...

147
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,553
perhaps we could go somewhere
and talk about what happened.

148
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:34,148
Is it cool if I tag along?

149
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,590
- Actually, if you don't mind...
- Yeah, that'd be great, Jug.

150
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:40,454
[Archie] He was maybe 5'10".

151
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,390
160 pounds or so.

152
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,551
And he was wearing dark
pants and a dark jacket?

153
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,863
Anything on that jacket?

154
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,531
Any symbol or insignia?

155
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,700
- You mean like a snake?
- No, it was just a jacket.

156
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:53,868
No snake.

157
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,137
And the ski mask that he had on...

158
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,105
No, it's not a ski mask.

159
00:07:58,107 --> 00:07:59,649
It's a hood, a black hood.

160
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,852
Homemade, like he'd cut
the eyes out himself.

161
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,844
And the guy's eyes were green.

162
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:06,680
Now, Pop Tate had a fairly
good idea of what happened

163
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:08,749
up until when your father was shot.

164
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,451
And then, well...

165
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,888
There are some gaps. And I
need you to help me fill those.

166
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,824
What did he do, our masked man?

167
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:20,995
After he shot my dad?

168
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,530
[gun fires]

169
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,865
He...

170
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,856
Nothing. He shot my dad,
ran out of the diner.

171
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,877
Who did this, Sheriff?

172
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,258
Archie, it's just... It's
too early to speculate.

173
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,918
But this guy, he was probably out of
his head on meth or the jingle jangle,

174
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,554
some Southside lowlife that was just

175
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,122
looking for a cash grab.

176
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,090
How much did he get? How much cash?

177
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:52,132
We're waiting to hear
about that from Pop Tate.

178
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:54,369
[sighs] Since this is Riverdale,

179
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:57,797
I have to ask. What if
robbery wasn't the motive?

180
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,976
What else could it be?

181
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:03,037
Well, I mean, I suppose it could be
someone who has a grudge against your dad.

182
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,905
Wanted to make it look like a robbery.

183
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:07,608
But I mean, it's just too early to tell.

184
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:11,768
[Veronica] <i>There are certain things no
one does better than Veronica Lodge.</i>

185
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:15,406
Makeovers, party planning, dance-offs,

186
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,552
dropping vintage bon mots
as if they were bonbons...

187
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:19,671
[chuckles]

188
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:23,157
Conversely, there are
things that I'm not good at.

189
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,281
Grief, bedside vigils,
comforting boyfriends...

190
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,547
Okay, well, that's the
old Veronica talking.

191
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,547
Old Veronica would've bolted by now.

192
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,636
But new Veronica doesn't
want to let Archie down.

193
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,004
And you won't.

194
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,107
Oh, and speaking of...

195
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,477
Archie, hey.

196
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,943
Were you not telling
Sheriff Keller something?

197
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,250
My dad told me that he and
Mrs. Lodge fired the Serpents

198
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,518
they had working on their crew.

199
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I know your dad vouches for them,

200
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,989
but what if one of them was
pissed off enough to do something?

201
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,526
Let me see what I can find out.

202
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,095
[Archie] Thanks, bro.

203
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:05,599
Archie Andrews? I'm Steven Masters,

204
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,632
- I'm your father's doctor.
- [Archie] How is he?

205
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:11,389
Well, we got the bullet out. And
we've stopped the internal bleeding.

206
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,641
But what's most worrisome is,

207
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,543
he's not breathing on his own yet.

208
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,044
- I need to see him.
- And you will.

209
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,780
As soon as we've got him set in a
room, you'll be able to sit with him.

210
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,253
Should be an hour or two at the most.

211
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,229
And until then, what am
I suppospp to do, nothing?

212
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:27,405
Maybe... Maybe you should
go home and get changed.

213
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,874
No, I'm not leaving.

214
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,844
No, Archie, wait. Veronica's right.

215
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,795
Here are your dad's clothes and personal
belongings. Everything he had on him.

216
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:36,363
Okay, well, yet another reason to go.

217
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,566
You can get your dad
a change of clothes.

218
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:40,534
Veronica will go with you. Right, Vee?

219
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,503
We'll hold the fort down here.

220
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:45,760
Archie, try not to worry.
Your dad is strong stock.

221
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,329
He's a fighter.

222
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,810
<i>Fred Andrews isn't one to leave
unfinished business behind.</i>

223
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,381
[Archie] Dad, come on. The car's
waiting. You're gonna be late.

224
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,650
I'm not ready to go, Archie.

225
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,452
Something doesn't feel right.

226
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:01,357
I'm gonna be fine, Dad. You
don't have to worry about me.

227
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,990
That's what I do, son.

228
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,346
That's what I've always done.

229
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:06,215
Yeah. And you deserve a break.

230
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,110
Okay? I'll handle things from now.

231
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:12,766
It doesn't feel right. Just...

232
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,570
- It's too soon.
- [sighs]

233
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,773
You can't change your mind now, Dad.

234
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,049
They're waiting for you.

235
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,118
Who's waiting?

236
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,854
Uncle Oscar, Grandpa Artie.

237
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,749
What are you talking
about, son? They're dead.

238
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:29,750
[pounding at door]

239
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,019
- That's them.
- [pounding continues]

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,560
[EKG beeping]

241
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:53,474
[dog barking]

242
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,537
Hey, Vegas.

243
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,981
Nobody's walked you, have they?

244
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,651
Must be... You must be
wondering what the hell happened.

245
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,421
Come on, let's go.

246
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,524
Hey, Archie, what are you doing?

247
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,725
I have to walk Vegas.

248
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,295
Like that?

249
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,929
You look like you're auditioning for
a teen reboot of <i>The Shining.</i>

250
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:17,131
No, you take your shower, I'll walk him.

251
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,168
Veronica. Have you ever
walked a dog in your life?

252
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:24,164
I've had dogs walked
for me, does that count?

253
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,942
Before we got Vegas, my dad was like,

254
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,141
"He's gonna be your
dog, Little Archie,

255
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,713
your responsibility. Are
you ready to walk him,

256
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,184
give him his food, fill his water bowl,

257
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,747
and take care of him
when he gets sick?"

258
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:44,278
I wanted him so bad, I was like,
"Yes, Dad, I'm ready. I'm so ready."

259
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,327
Cutest origin story ever.

260
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,763
- And?
- And now,

261
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,599
when I get home late
from football practice,

262
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,735
my dad's already walked him.

263
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:58,757
On Saturday mornings, Dad
takes him out so I can sleep in.

264
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,741
Every time Vegas gets sick,

265
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,459
Dad always goes with us to the vet.

266
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,888
The truth is, no one loves
Vegas more than my dad.

267
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,852
[Tall Boy] I got nervous when
you said to meet at the hospital.

268
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,901
I was wondering about when you
said the Serpents had my back.

269
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,604
Does that courtesy extend to
a guy who's like my brother,

270
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,906
and a man who's like
a second father to me?

271
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,832
What do you need?

272
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:37,545
Fred Andrews, my buddy's
dad, was just shot,

273
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,661
during a robbery at Pop's.

274
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:41,436
The guy was in a black hood.

275
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,067
Serpents don't wear masks.

276
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,269
Yeah, I get it.

277
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,820
But some of those Serpents
were working for Fred Andrews

278
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,790
when, for reasons of his own, he
decided to let them go suddenly.

279
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,626
Maybe someone took it
personally and went rogue.

280
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:54,328
You guys know every hidey-hole in town.

281
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:58,155
Someone has to have heard something
about what went down at Pop's.

282
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,891
All right.

283
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:03,226
We'll knock some heads. Let you know.

284
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:33,234
Archie?

285
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,770
You okay?

286
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,039
I'm okay.

287
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,274
I'm fine.

288
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
Thought you might want some company.

289
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:42,937
Thank you.

290
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:47,851
Of course all any of us can
think about is Mr. Andrews.

291
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:51,178
But if we weren't so
focused on his well-being,

292
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,314
- I'd be asking if you and...
- We didn't.

293
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,248
Jughead and I didn't do it.

294
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:56,884
If that's what you were asking.

295
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,602
But wait, like, no... [scoffs]

296
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,105
He told me he loved me.

297
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,688
Wait, what?

298
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,524
Jughead Jones said "I love you"?

299
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,593
Mr. "I'm weird, I'm a weirdo"...

300
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,962
And I told him I loved him back.

301
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,298
Well...

302
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:11,412
And then things got...

303
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,834
- Complicated. [chuckles]
- Weird?

304
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,471
In a "my boyfriend may be
joining the Serpents" kind of way.

305
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,365
Betty, no. No way.

306
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,342
I mean, did you learn
nothing from me and Joaquin?

307
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,592
Oh, come on, Joaquin was nice.

308
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,329
Yeah, when he wasn't dumping
bodies in Sweetwater River

309
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:28,165
or mopping up buckets of blood.

310
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:30,968
[sighs]

311
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,953
What the hell?

312
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:41,682
Cheryl?

313
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:51,246
Cheryl, what's going on?

314
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:52,988
Is that your mom? What happened?

315
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,082
Oh, haven't you heard?

316
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,878
There was a terrible fire
at Thornhill last night.

317
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:00,280
I might've perished if
not for Mommy's heroics.

318
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:03,417
Oh, my God, is this the apocalypse?

319
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,051
After my ordeal at Sweetwater River,

320
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,188
I was asleep when the fire started.

321
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:12,231
They think it was a breeze knocking
over a lit candle, catching the curtains.

322
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,345
Mommy got home from the Jubilee
and rushed headlong into the blaze,

323
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,798
risking her life to save mine.

324
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,187
Unfortunately, she suffered third-degree
burns and acute smoke inhalation.

325
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:24,939
What are you two doing here?

326
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,545
[sighs]

327
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,947
What's going on?

328
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,852
I took your dad's things out
of the bag. I hope that's okay.

329
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,327
Where's, uh, where's his wallet?

330
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:50,533
I'm not sure.

331
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,199
That's all that was in there.

332
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,434
It would've been in his coat.

333
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,438
- Are you sure you didn't see it?
- I didn't.

334
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,640
Maybe it was in the truck?
Or back at the hospital?

335
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:03,444
No, this is... this is everything
they had. You heard the nurse.

336
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,414
Okay, well, worst case
scenario, it's just a wallet.

337
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,350
Everything that is important
to my dad is in that watlet.

338
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:10,618
He doesn't go anywhere without it.

339
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,952
For all we know, it's at Pop's.

340
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,638
Why did you even open the bag?

341
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,957
I thought... I wanted to help.

342
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,157
No, seriously, why're we here?

343
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,461
Veronica, I didn't ask you to come. I
didn't even want to come here. And...

344
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,700
[sighs] Just forget it.

345
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,254
Just go. I'll take care of this. I'll see

346
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,668
I'll see you back at the
hospital or I'll call you.

347
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,878
- You really want me to go?
- I do, yeah.

348
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,957
- I'm sorry, no.
- What?

349
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:01,502
I'm sorry, but I'm not going.

350
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,406
Archie, you shouldn't
be alone right now.

351
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:09,877
You're angry, and hurting,
and probably terrified.

352
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,313
I know I am.

353
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:16,183
So go ahead. Yell at me
and try to push me away

354
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,619
but I'm not going anywhere.

355
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:24,623
You okay?

356
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:26,994
Come here.

357
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,629
- [sobs]
- Come here.

358
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,939
[IPhone ringing]

359
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:43,884
- Is it the hospital?
- It's Sheriff Keller.

360
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,354
Hi, Sheriff.

361
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,656
What, right now?

362
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,259
Come on in, guys.

363
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:55,730
So, this is who we've picked up so far.

364
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,367
All of them have a history of armed
robbery or some other violent crime.

365
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,035
So, you feelin' up for this?

366
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,073
- Yeah.
- All right.

367
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:08,842
Put 'em on.

368
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,619
[Sheriff Keller] One, step forward.

369
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,463
- No.
- [Sheriff Keller] Step back.

370
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:32,509
Number two, step forward.

371
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,073
No.

372
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,478
[Sheriff Keller] Step back.
Three, step forward.

373
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:47,848
No.

374
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,555
- [bell jingles]
- No.

375
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,251
Wait, Archie's where?

376
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,318
At the sheriff's
station, doing a line-up.

377
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:03,396
He asked me to come be here
with Fred until he gets back.

378
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:06,233
Well, that's gonna be traumatizing
for him. We should go down there.

379
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,168
Wait, actually, can you
guys do me a huge favor?

380
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,062
Mr. Andrews' wallet is missing.

381
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,898
We're thinking it might be at Pop's.

382
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:15,326
That, or the guy who
shot Fred might have it.

383
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:17,576
Well, if it was just
some rando robbing Pop's,

384
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,147
then he probably took the money
and then got rid of the wallet.

385
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:21,882
[stutters] Unless it
wasn't just some rando.

386
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,550
Unless it was premeditated in some way.

387
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:26,383
What? Is that an actual theory?

388
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,622
Not according to Sheriff Keller,

389
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,658
but if you ask me, people have grudges.

390
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,894
People have enemies. I
mean, think of where we live.

391
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,695
Fathers are killing their sons.

392
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:37,397
It's entirely conceivable
this was a hit.

393
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:41,067
Okay, or the wallet's just at
Pop's. So we'll check it out, Vee.

394
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:50,877
- [Betty] A motorcycle?
- Hop on.

395
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,846
Without a helmet?

396
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:55,549
You can use mine. Or we can walk.

397
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:57,317
We can take a bus or...

398
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,486
Or we can call your mom.

399
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:03,757
- Oh. No, just go slow, okay?
- [laughing]

400
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,192
Oh.

401
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:10,096
No, no, no. It's actually much
more dangerous if we go slow.

402
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:12,399
You are gonna need to hold tight.

403
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,367
[engine revving]

404
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,114
<i>In nomine Patris, et
Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

405
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,322
What are we praying for?

406
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:38,391
Fred's speedy recovery or a quick death?

407
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:41,929
Veronica, why on Earth
would I pray for that?

408
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:45,665
Jughead said that what happened
to Mr. Andrews may have been...

409
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,634
a hit.

410
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:51,438
But who would be evil
enough to do thatthnd why?

411
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,540
But then I remembered how you wanted

412
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,382
Fred to sell his share of the
company back to you and Daddy

413
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,823
because he and Daddy wouldn't get along.

414
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:01,281
Which is a threat, if I ever heard one.

415
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:04,751
And because you are so determined
to paint your father as a villain,

416
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:07,854
you assume he must have
put a hit on Fred Andrews.

417
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:09,390
Brilliant.

418
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,436
Not him.

419
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,527
You.

420
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:18,498
I don't think you're
an innocent pawn, Mom.

421
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,834
I think you're Daddy's
eyes and ears on the ground.

422
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:22,988
Calling the shots.

423
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,438
Do you genuinely believe that?

424
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,898
If the Manolo Blahnik fits...

425
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:37,384
[Hermione] <i>Mija...</i>

426
00:23:37,387 --> 00:23:40,184
Your disrespect will
no longer be tolerated.

427
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:43,832
Not by me, and certainly not by
your father when he comes home.

428
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,792
So a word of advice,

429
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:48,746
get back in line with this family.

430
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:51,830
Because you are a Lodge
before anything else.

431
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,233
[chuckles softly]

432
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,004
You know, I should slap you
for what you're insinuating,

433
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,107
but I'm not a violent person.

434
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:11,518
[Archie] Thanks, Reggie.

435
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:13,954
Bulldogs are here for you.

436
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,195
And so are the Pussycats.

437
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,629
We're sending your dad our prayers

438
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,066
and giving him as many of
our nine lives as he needs.

439
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,335
Thanks, Josie.

440
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:25,899
Veronica said that you were
down at the sheriff's station?

441
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,834
That maybe they got the guy?

442
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,695
Yeah, but it wasn't him.
He's still out there.

443
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:31,881
[Dr. Masters] Archie.

444
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,991
He's in Room 12, you can see him now.

445
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,455
Okay, great.

446
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,813
Listen, he hasn't woken up yet.

447
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,148
But talk to him, coax him back.

448
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,151
Keep it positive. Honestly, that
could make all the difference.

449
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:57,931
[Archie] Dad.

450
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:01,601
I don't know if you can
hear me. Hopefully you can.

451
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:06,239
I'm only supposed to talk about
good things, which... [scoffs]

452
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:08,241
Kinda limits my options, but...

453
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:13,804
What can I tell you?

454
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:18,351
[sighs] I'm doing it, Dad.
I'm asking her tonight.

455
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:20,805
[Fred] Wow. Would you look at that.

456
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,508
You know, Veronica's gonna love it.

457
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,947
Well, she better, she picked it out.

458
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,317
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- [chuckles]

459
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,529
Pop, you are not gonna believe this.

460
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:31,564
Archie is getting married.

461
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,366
Is that right?

462
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:36,036
Well, well, well. Time dies.

463
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,133
What?

464
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:51,117
[bell jingling]

465
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:55,555
Oh, my God...

466
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,326
[thumping]

467
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,497
Sorry, kids, we, uh... We're
closed today. There was, uh...

468
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:08,036
Pop, we heard about what happened.

469
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,869
We just got back from the hospital

470
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,671
to look for Mr. Andrews'
wallet. It's missing.

471
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,706
- Is he...
- He's out of surgery.

472
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,515
We'll know more when he wakes up.

473
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:16,851
All right.

474
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:18,945
The police have already looked.

475
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:20,613
But if you wanna double-check,

476
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,916
he was in that booth, there.

477
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:27,320
So, uh...

478
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:29,881
What happened, Pop?

479
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:31,091
From your point of view?

480
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:32,959
[Pop] I wish I knew.

481
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:35,428
As soon as that gun turned off me, I...

482
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:38,303
God help me, I dove.

483
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:41,634
I don't even remember calling
the police, but I guess I did.

484
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,676
Hey, how much cash did the
creep end up taking, Pop?

485
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:45,939
Not a penny.

486
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,408
[snaps fingers] I knew it.

487
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:52,512
What kind of thief shoots up a joint and
then doesn't take a single dollar bill?

488
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:54,447
He wasn't a thief.

489
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,375
Over the years, this place
has been robbed many times.

490
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:00,245
Bricks through the windows,
even, during the riots.

491
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,722
I've looked plenty of thugs in the eye,

492
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:04,567
but this man...

493
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,093
His goal was something else.

494
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,686
Darker.

495
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,734
It was like the Angel of
Death had come to Riverdale.

496
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,050
Jeez, Pop, lighten up.

497
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:23,663
You sound like the cranky old guy
in the <i>Friday the 13th</i> movies.

498
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,266
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

499
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,881
The wallet's not here.

500
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,849
Hey, you kids hungry?

501
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:33,353
- Oh, no, we're good, Pop.
- Oh, I'm always hungry, yeah.

502
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,154
In times of crisis,

503
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:48,535
some people lose their appetite.

504
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,438
But me, mine increases tenfold.

505
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:57,710
I haven't eaten since last night.

506
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:02,766
I don't want to be thinking
about this while Mr. Andrews

507
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,651
is how he is...

508
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,487
But last night,

509
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,434
when you put on the Serpent jacket,

510
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,458
- it meant something, Jug.
- [sighing]

511
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,029
Yeah, it meant there were, like, ten
biker dudes standing in front of me

512
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,797
and I didn't think I could say no.

513
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,066
It fit you like a glove, Jug.

514
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,025
Like a second skin.

515
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:25,596
And the look on your face... You
weren't acting for the Serpents.

516
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,440
And now you're riding a
motorcycle, which you've never done.

517
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:31,844
Betty, I'm not a Serpent, okay?

518
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:34,414
That might be my dad's
life, but it's not mine.

519
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,382
What about your
soon-to-be foster family?

520
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:37,653
They're from the Southside.

521
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:40,082
[stammers] If they have
ties to the Serpents,

522
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,200
- they could try to...
- Indoctrinate me?

523
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,793
Don't worry. I've actually
made a decision about that.

524
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:48,461
They'll cover for me
with my social worker,

525
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:50,390
but I'm not even going
to be staying with them.

526
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:52,094
I'm gonna be at the
trailer. My dad's trailer.

527
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,095
What? Why?

528
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,264
Betty...

529
00:28:56,663 --> 00:29:00,565
[sighs] Archie almost lost his dad.

530
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:03,643
He may still. And facing facts,

531
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:06,742
my dad is going away
for a long-ass time.

532
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,049
Wearing that jacket and riding his bike,

533
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,883
living in the trailer...

534
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,698
Does mean something.

535
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,726
Just kinda hoping that it means

536
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,961
I'll always be close
to him no matter what.

537
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:24,097
I don't want to see you get hurt.

538
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,299
Or hurting someone else.

539
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:28,668
Not because you did it on purpose,

540
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,070
but because that's the Serpents' world.

541
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:33,840
That's how they live. Isn't it?

542
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:41,581
[Betty sighs]

543
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,665
Good. You're awake.

544
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:51,330
Now, here's the realz, Baby Jane.

545
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:55,868
I'm telling everyone you ran back
into that towering inferno to save me,

546
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,511
not that hideous family
portrait that you love so much.

547
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:00,773
And that what happened at Thornhill

548
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:04,777
was a terrible, tragic accident.

549
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:10,219
If you tell anyone the truth
about what happened with the fire,

550
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:14,730
I'll tell everyone about what really
happened in the barn with Daddy.

551
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,125
You were cruel to me, Mother.

552
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:24,173
It was abuse, plain and simple.

553
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,287
So henceforth,

554
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:32,338
if you breathe, it is
because I give you air.

555
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:36,763
If you drink, it is because
I poured your cup myself.

556
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:41,547
And if you move, it is quietly,

557
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,148
and with my blessing.

558
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,317
[gasping]

559
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,819
[Cheryl sighs]

560
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,789
Things are going to be
different now, Mommy.

561
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,191
Better.

562
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:54,994
You'll see.

563
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,845
For your dad

564
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:10,609
when he wakes up, which
he will, very, very soon.

565
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:14,917
[both chuckle]

566
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,750
Just to tide him over until
we find his tried and true.

567
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,219
When did you even go to Barnaby's?

568
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:21,887
I didn't. I sent
Smithers. Is that cheating?

569
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,715
You are

570
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:30,029
the best girlfriend ever.

571
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:32,838
- [chuckles softly]
- And I do not deserve you.

572
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:33,999
Why do you say that?

573
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,568
Ronnie,

574
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:41,602
can I, uh... Can I
tell you about this...

575
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:45,649
This thing that happened
at Pop's? With my dad?

576
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:47,274
- Yeah...
- [Jughead] Who's hungry?

577
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:50,249
We've got burgers and
fries and onion rings.

578
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:52,284
- [all cheering]
- [man] Nice, Jugs.

579
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,719
[woman] Excuse me.

580
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,250
Your dad would be so proud of you, Arch.

581
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,763
[Jughead] Yeah, you've really
been just a rock-star god

582
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,665
through all of this.

583
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,072
[Veronica] Archie...

584
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:11,170
What is it? Talk to us.

585
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,971
Maybe we can help.

586
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,378
[Archie sighs]

587
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:22,214
Guys, there's something I
haven't told you, 'cause I'm...

588
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,450
So... I'm so ashamed.

589
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:25,984
[gun fires]

590
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:31,123
After the guy fired, I should've
rushed to my dad straight away.

591
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,643
<i>Or I should've tackled the guy,</i>

592
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:35,394
<i>but I was... I was paralyzed.</i>

593
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:43,435
<i>I didn't move, not even when
the guy walked up to me,</i>

594
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:45,636
<i>and he held his gun to my head.</i>

595
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,074
<i>And I just closed my eyes,
I don't know how long.</i>

596
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:52,544
Long enough for the guy to have
taken my dad's wallet, I guess.

597
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,216
But I didn't open them
until I heard the bell.

598
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,184
- [bell jingling]
<i>- Pop's bell.</i>

599
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:01,587
<i>Which meant he was gone.</i>

600
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:11,930
There was nothing
else you could've done.

601
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:15,467
That's not true, Betty. I could've
done anything to comfort my dad.

602
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:17,536
To get the gun away from the guy.

603
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,905
I was a coward.

604
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,476
And now, me and my dad were
witnesses, Pop Tate too.

605
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,845
This guy may have my dad's wallet,

606
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:28,480
all his information.

607
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,185
What if he comes back?

608
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,377
Cheryl. What're you doing?

609
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:01,980
Paying you back for saving
me at Sweetwater River.

610
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:06,351
You gave me the kiss
of life, Archie Andrews.

611
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,954
Now I've given it to your dad.

612
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,624
He's going to be just fine.

613
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:19,754
Toodles.

614
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,401
[EKG beeping]

615
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,946
I've been thinking about
what I can say to you, Dad.

616
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,415
And I kinda started imagining
what we would've talked about

617
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,917
at Pop's this morning, if
things hadn't gone to hell.

618
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,200
You would've asked me about Veronica.

619
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:43,882
I would've told you how
crazy I am about her.

620
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,494
[chuckles] You would have
said, "That's great,

621
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:51,897
but take it slow, Archie,

622
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,865
no one's getting married."

623
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,968
[bagpipes playing]

624
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:21,418
[priest] Today we celebrate the love
between two incredible young people.

625
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:26,231
I've had the privilege of knowing
Archie Andrews all his life...

626
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,100
[continues indistinctly]

627
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,175
[static hissing]

628
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,188
[inaudible]

629
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,065
[gun fires]

630
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,767
[EKG beeping]

631
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,200
- [Fred moans]
- Dad?

632
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,950
Dad?

633
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,612
Can you hear me?

634
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:15,847
[sighs] Thank God.

635
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:17,761
Dad.

636
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:24,757
[thunder rumbling]

637
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,740
Dad, I just want you to know I'm
sorry I didn't do more at Pop's.

638
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,621
Archie...

639
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,559
And whether or not Sheriff Keller
finds the person who did this or not,

640
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:34,886
you don't have to worry.

641
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:38,205
I'm gonna protect you.

642
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,142
Nothing like this is ever gonna
happen to you again, I swear it.

643
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,859
Son...

644
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:47,140
That's why I came back.

645
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:50,969
To protect you.

646
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:53,238
[thunder rumbling]

647
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,162
Sure I can't give you a ride home?

648
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,249
I think if my mom saw me
getting off your motorcycle,

649
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:06,317
she'd come out with a shotgun.

650
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,019
- That's fair enough.
- [chuckles]

651
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,873
Jug?

652
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,461
What you said at Pop's...

653
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:19,786
I heard you.

654
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:24,536
Whatever you need to do or explore,

655
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,702
I support you.

656
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:53,053
What the hell, guys? What is this?

657
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:54,689
Went out like you asked.

658
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:56,972
This guy was holding
court in the Whyte Wyrm.

659
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,769
Talking about how if Freddy Andrews

660
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:01,316
was gonna let Hiram
Lodge's bitch run the show,

661
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,644
fire his crew, then it's
good he was gut-shot.

662
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:05,715
So we thought we might press him a bit.

663
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,063
See if it was all just talk.

664
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,680
- And?
- And...

665
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:11,916
after a lengthy
cross-examination, yeah,

666
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:14,652
we've concluded, he was
just being a loudmouth.

667
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:16,988
[stutters] What did
you bring him here for

668
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,223
if he didn't even do anything?

669
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,792
So you could see we'd
done what you asked.

670
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,630
So you could tell your old
man. That's important to us.

671
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:26,746
With or without the jacket,

672
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:28,372
you're a Serpent.

673
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:38,509
[lock clicks]

674
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,845
[sighs]

675
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:42,747
[Hermione] Veronica.

676
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:47,024
[speaking Spanish]

677
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:53,157
I came home early to surprise you.

678
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,767
And imagine my surprise when
you weren't here to greet me.

679
00:38:57,997 --> 00:38:59,763
And she drank your Cristal.

680
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,599
So disrespectful.

681
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:04,731
Not like you at all, <i>mija.</i>

682
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,258
I've changed.

683
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,073
You have no idea.

684
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,082
The question is...

685
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,606
Have you?

686
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,804
Not so much that I still don't
want a kiss hello from my daughter.

687
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:40,344
By the way, in case either
of you were wondering,

688
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:42,006
Mr. Andrews woke up.

689
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,552
He's going to make it.

690
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,335
I know we're all
really happy about that.

[Jughead] <i>Once Mrs. Andrews got to town,</i>

692
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:08,171
<i>and Mr. Andrews was back at
home, recovering in his own bed,</i>

693
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:11,936
<i>Archie's true vigil began.</i>

694
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,335
<i>He made a promise,</i>

695
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,816
<i>a vow to protect his father from harm.</i>

696
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:28,200
<i>And as long as the man m
s out there in the night,</i>

697
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:33,224
<i>Archie intended to keep that promise.</i>

698
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:45,059
<i>Never imagining that the Angel of Death</i>

00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:47,071
<i>was stalking different streets tonight</i>

700
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:52,443
<i>in the small town of Greendale, just
on the other side of Sweetwater River.</i>

702
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:58,116
How was that, Ms. Grundy?

703
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,206
Very good. You're making
wonderful progress, Ben.

704
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,026
So you'll come by tomorrow, then?

705
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,261
Absolutely.

706
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,960
I'll see you tomorrow.
