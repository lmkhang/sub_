[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,947
[Black Hood] <i>This is the Black Hood.
I want to cleanse Riverdale of sinners.</i>

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,698
I can't keep doing this.

4
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:11,537
<i>I need you to cut your friends
out of your life, or I will, my way.</i>

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,249
I'll consider reopening
<i>The Red and the Black</i> on two conditions:

6
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:20,045
One, no gangs. Two, no jingle-jangle.
See you trafficking in either, we're done.

7
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:23,966
Hang with the Serpents.
Ghoulies get a whiff that you're alone...

[Jughead grunting]

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:29,638
Tall Boy gave me this jacket.
It's time I start wearing it.

10
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:33,058
- Is that...?
- Jingle-jangle.

11
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,812
Nick, I mean it. Stop!

12
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:39,523
We didn't get a chance to talk last night.

13
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,820
I want Nick to pay, to suffer,
to burn in hell.

14
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:47,447
- [Black Hood] <i>Give me another name.</i>
- Nick St. Clair.

15
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,787
[Jughead] <i>In Riverdale, everyone
wears a mask, not just the Black Hood.</i>

16
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:58,124
<i>But every so often the mask slips</i>

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,795
<i>and our true selves are laid bare
for all the world to see.</i>

18
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:03,755
Morning.

19
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,632
You, uh...?

20
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:06,758
You hungry?

21
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:09,428
You never have to ask me that.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,096
Cool.

23
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,020
[Jughead] <i>So, we scramble
to put it back on,</i>

24
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:21,523
<i>like a kid in a cheap Halloween costume,
but it's too late.</i>

25
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:24,234
<i>People have already seen
what's underneath...</i>

26
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:27,445
<i>and it's terrifying.</i>

27
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:33,618
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,507
What? Here to finish
what your little friend started?

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,134
You're alive.

30
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:54,514
Yeah. Tell that bitch Veronica
she's lucky I'm not pressing charges.

31
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:56,975
[Mr. St. Clair] Nicholas,
why aren't you dressed yet?

32
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,268
And who's this?

33
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,438
You're not safe here, okay? Any of you.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,273
You need to go...

35
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:07,069
- Nicholas St. Clair?
- He is, and I'm his father.

36
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:10,530
- Is there a problem?
- [Keller] There's a complaint against him.

37
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:14,242
He'll have to come to the station.
You and your wife, as well.

38
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,286
You might wanna get dressed, son.

39
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,876
Should I ask what you're doing here?

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,256
I'm... making sure
Nick got what was coming to him.

41
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,258
Go home, Betty.

42
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,348
[cell phone rings]

43
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,522
You didn't kill him.

44
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,150
[Black Hood]
<i>Nick isn't one of Riverdale's sons.</i>

45
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,069
<i>You've already given me
the most wonderful gift.</i>

46
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,737
<i>You said Nick's name.</i>

47
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,450
<i>In that moment of nakedness,
you let me see the real Betty Cooper.</i>

48
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,952
<i>And she was beautiful and righteous.</i>

49
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,579
<i>Judge, jury, executioner...</i>

50
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,916
No. No, that's not... I'm... That's...

51
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:07,795
<i>Now that I've seen your true self, Betty,
the real work can begin.</i>

52
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,131
What do you mean...?

53
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,507
[line beeps]

54
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,596
[cell phone chimes]

55
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,147
[Hermione] Penelope, thank you for coming.

56
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,275
We called as soon as Cheryl told us.

57
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,444
I appreciate that.

58
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:35,073
I just wish you'd stopped her
from talking to Sheriff Keller.

59
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:39,286
Lord knows what Cheryl did or said
to the St. Clair boy to provoke him.

60
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,580
According to Veronica, nothing.

61
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:46,334
Hermione, Hiram,
I want this handled discreetly.

62
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,257
Well, I'm confident
that the St. Clairs feel the same way.

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,800
[Penelope] Then it's settled.

64
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:58,180
I'll talk to that idiot Keller
and tell him we won't be pressing charges.

65
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,723
After all...

66
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,268
nothing really happened to Cheryl.

67
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:10,650
Cheryl, I'm... so sorry.

68
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,570
Don't be silly. I'm used to it.

69
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,782
And besides, you heard what Mommy said.
Nothing really happened to me.

70
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,160
- Nick roofied you. He...
- I'm fine.

71
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,995
Veronica, everything's fine.

72
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,580
If everything is fine,

73
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,291
why did we just call Sheriff Keller
and make a statement?

74
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,544
Momentary lapse in sanity.
I mean, can you even imagine?

75
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,506
Me against Nick St. Clair
in a courtroom battle royale?

76
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,841
- I'd be a laughingstock.
- Cheryl, wait.

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,888
It's not just you.
He's done it to other girls.

78
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,474
I mean, hell,
he even tried to do it to me.

79
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,935
The night before the open house.

80
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,145
Did you tell your parents?

81
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,276
Yet you were happy to fill them in
on my after-dark drama?

82
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,029
I won't be a puppet
for your thirst for vengeance.

83
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,407
You want justice?
You go after Nick in court, Veronica.

84
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,414
[Toni] Thanks for letting me sleep over.

85
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:10,669
Now on to the next crash pad
until my uncle stops locking me out.

86
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,420
[Jughead] My trailer is your trailer.

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,258
- Last night was...
- A PG-13 grope session?

88
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:17,592
Oof.

89
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,636
Way to knock a guy down a peg.

90
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,013
Look, cards on the table...

91
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,474
you're not over Betty.

92
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,602
And I'm not interested
in being anybody's rebound.

93
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,104
Besides...

94
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,565
I'm more into girls anyways.

95
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,736
Roger that.

96
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,199
[Betty] I needed to clear my head,
and I did.

97
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,787
And I realized
that this is just a sick game to him.

98
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,372
Psychological torture.

99
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:49,958
So...

100
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:55,672
I'm done with the Black Hood,
with his letters, with his Simon Says.

101
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,092
- What happens when he calls again?
- I won't answer.

102
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,847
I can't... keep playing, I can't.

103
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,725
- Didn't he threaten Polly?
- He did. I talked to her.

104
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:10,395
People at the farm are gonna
help her disappear until it's safe.

105
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,856
Whenever that is. Jughead and Veronica?

106
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,193
- We have to tell them the truth.
- We will. Let's let things settle first.

107
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,778
Make sure it's all over...

108
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,494
[cell phones ringing]

109
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:30,874
- Mom?
- Dad?

110
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,878
[Alice] Riverdale's best
and brightest, huh?

111
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,673
- Alice, thank you for hosting.
- Of course, Mayor McCoy.

112
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:42,302
When I heard what happened,
I decided we should come together

113
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:47,015
to deal with this motley crew
of liars, dope fiends, and fornicators.

114
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,726
Except for Betty,
who was smart enough to leave

115
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,811
before it was a bacchanalian free-for-all.

116
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,731
- Oh, my God. Mom, please don't.
- Great. Here we go.

117
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,984
- Saint Betty and Succubus Veronica.
- [Fred] Just for clarity, Alice,

118
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:01,696
- you're hosting this to gloat?
- I may have taken jingle-jangle,

119
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,283
- but she had a psychotic break.
- Cut her some slack, Veronica.

120
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,952
- She broke up with Jughead.
- Hashtag "Bughead is no more"?

121
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,287
- Betty didn't tell me?
- Ahem.

122
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:12,916
Careful throwing stones there,
acid-queen Alice.

123
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,378
I'm not the only one that knows the story
behind that mug shot

124
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,588
your daughter printed in her paper.

125
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,967
I, for one, would like to know who brought
the jingle-jangle to the party.

126
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:30,767
Reginald, not a single word out
of your mouth until we get a lawyer.

127
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,354
All Reggie needs to tell us, Melinda,
is how he acquired it.

128
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:38,316
- Gang member who deals on the Southside.
- You have a dealer?

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,653
Once again, mayor, the Southside
is the source of all our problems.

130
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,947
Is he a Serpent?
Does he go to Southside High?

131
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,657
- I think so.
- [Archie] Does it matter?

132
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,201
- Not all Serpents are dealers.
- Archie, not helping.

133
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:50,286
We shouldn't have taken the JJ,

134
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,248
but Nick asked Reggie to get it
and then pushed it on us.

135
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,960
He should be in the hot seat.
He's the one who roofied Cheryl...

136
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,172
Prosecuting him would be difficult,
given that all witnesses were high.

137
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,758
Josie and I saw Nick with Cheryl
the night after the party.

138
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:05,260
Neither of us were on jingle-jangle.

139
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,470
[Keller] The drug stays in your system
for three days.

140
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,765
If I drug-tested you right now,
you'd have a credibility problem.

141
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,434
Josie, you took that drug?

142
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,520
You put that poison in your system

143
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:18,440
knowing the way your father
struggled with addiction?

144
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:21,526
I see.

145
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,487
From this moment on,

146
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,032
bringing the Southside under control
is my number one priority.

147
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,076
If it means razing it to the ground

148
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,121
or arresting every single Serpent
in sight,

149
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:35,957
starting at that high school, so be it.

150
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,835
Let's go, Josephine.

151
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,504
Now.

152
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,848
"People have associated this school
with the plagues of the Southside,

153
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,683
drugs, gangs, violence.

154
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:57,562
But, like the Southside,
there is a community here.

155
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,232
And while the decay is real,
it is not irreversible."

156
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,987
I'm impressed, Jughead.

157
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,408
Where did you find the time to put out
an issue of the <i>Red and Black</i>

158
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,827
while pledging the Southside Serpents?

159
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,164
I'm not blind.

160
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,458
We had a deal.

161
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:24,297
The Serpents,
they truly are a community, Mr. Phillips.

162
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,133
- A community of drug dealers.
- That's not the Serpents.

163
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,427
That's the Ghoulies.
That's my next article.

164
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,305
- Jughead, when you said you wanted to...
- [cell phone chimes]

165
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:37,352
Uh, will you excuse me? Just two seconds.
I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips.

166
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,148
Jug! Jug.

167

[Betty] If the Sugarman exists
and I find out who he is,

326
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,232
I can't just give up his name.

327
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:05,109
The Black Hood would kill him.

I'm in.

332
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,378
This isn't an alliance with the Ghoulies.
This is a hostile takeover.

333
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:29,216
God, who knows how long Tall Boy
has been planning on betraying us.

334
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,011
Maybe I stall,
just until Sweet Pea and Toni get out.

335
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:35,222
I just hope they'd rather go to war
with the Ghoulies than start...

336
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,058
- Jughead.
- ...dealing jingle-jangle.

337
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,101
You joined the Serpents to keep the peace.

338
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,730
My dad would never sit back
and let this happen, so, neither will I.

339
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:48,819
- So, unless you have any better ideas...
- Not me. But, dude, what you just said...

340
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,700
[FP] Start from the beginning, boys.

341
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:05,476
[Jughead] Hey, you can reprimand me
for joining the Serpents later,

342
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,311
but if we don't do something now...

343
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,150
there will be no more Serpents.
It'll just be the Ghoulies.

344
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,114
Ghoulies dress like fops,
but they're a nasty crew.

345
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,742
The Serpents have survived worse, though.

346
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:26,205
Much worse. The only hitch is,
it sounds like you're outmanned,

347
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:29,667
which means you gotta avoid bloodshed
at all costs.

348
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,545
- I agree. A hundred percent.
- [FP] So, outthink them.

349
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:34,046
This is about territory.

350
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,756
If there's one thing Ghoulies love,

351
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,843
it's their crazy souped-up retro cars
and hearses.

352
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,011
You catch my Riverdale drift, boys?

353
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:49,979
Challenge them to a street race,
one-on-one.

354
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,983
But keep it on the DL.
It's illegal. It'll get you locked up.

355
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,485
- Go on.
- [FP] Set the terms of the race.

356
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,488
Their guy wins, the Serpents roll over.

357
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:03,284
But if we win, the Ghoulies back off.

358
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:08,372
And maybe you raise the stakes.
Whoever wins controls Southside High.

359
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,876
We get rid of the Ghoulies
and get rid of the jingle-jangle

360
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,753
and get McCoy off our back.

361
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:23,596
[Cheryl] That's me, that's Jason,
and that's the Sugarman.

362
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,433
Remember? You'd tell us tales
of how he was friends with Daddy?

363
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,895
We were to stay up in our rooms
whenever he visited Thornhill?

364
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:35,107
Was he one of Daddy's business associates?

365
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:40,154
Not maple syrup,
but the other kind of business?

366
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:45,618
After all you kept from me about Daddy,
about Jason's death,

367
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,162
is this another piece
of your cryptic puzzle?

368
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:51,207
As usual, Cheryl, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

369
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,084
I never told you any such stories.

370
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,086
As for your father's business dealings,

371
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,299
you know full well that all his records
were either seized by the police

372
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:03,135
or burned in the fire you started.

373
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:08,516
[Kevin groans]

374
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:14,480
- Pickens Park? More like Needle Park.
- I wouldn't even go cruising here.

375
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:19,443
Hey, uh, feel free to, you know, pitch in.

376
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:25,574
I get you're pretty much Beyoncé,
but today, you're just like us commoners.

377
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,202
I think your biceps can handle it, Mantle.

378
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,704
- You trying to get me to flex?
- [Veronica] Josie.

379
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:33,582
You mind if I borrow Reggie
for a New York minute?

380
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,292
Please. Take him.

381
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,420
Love watching me walk away, huh?

382
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:41,757
What do you want, Veronica?

383
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,093
We were kind of
in the middle of something.

384
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:46,804
I want the name
of your jingle-jangle contact,

385
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,722
and I won't take no for an answer.

386
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:52,977
Betty, you have to talk to Jughead.

387
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,187
Soon, I promise.

388
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:58,607
I just need to take care of a few things.

389
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:14,331
I'll go out on a limb
and guess you're Verne. You got my stuff?

390
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,044
- I don't take American Excess.
- Will this do?

391
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:22,089
My girl and I
need a reason to live tonight.

392
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,675
She broke up with her beau.
Full spiral. Tragic.

393
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,135
One fifty.

394
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,097
I know you're overcharging me,
but I'm desperate.

395
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,601
My compliments to the Sugarman.

396
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:40,190
Did I get it wrong? Isn't that the name
of the genius behind these sweet treats?

397
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:41,609
Have you ever met him?

398
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,321
What about my change, asshat?

399
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:51,702
Our Drugstore Cowboy
should be passing you

400
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:55,038
<i>in three... two... one.</i>

401
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:56,707
I've got eyes on him.

402
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:00,294
[rock music playing]

403
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,378
[Jughead] Me and my boy...

404
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,340
wanna challenge you to a race.

405
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,009
If we win...

406
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,054
Serpents remain autonomous...

407
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:12,890
and you quit dealing at Southside High.

408
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,851
[sniffs] And if we win?

409
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:17,519
We fold...

410
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:22,066
and you can continue polluting Southside
with your little straws of death.

411
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:26,570
So, the mighty Serpent Prince
has some stones, but not much else.

412
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:29,990
So, unless Your Highness wants to put some
of Daddy's territory on the table,

413
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:31,784
I got no reason to agree to a race.

414
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,118
[door slams]

415
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,663
They were following me.
Tried to get in the garage.

416
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:36,872
- Veronica?
- Betty?

417
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:37,956
- Archie?
- Jughead?

418
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,250
[all] What are you doing here?

419
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:44,755
- Wait. So, these are your bitches?
- I beg your misogynistic pardon?

420
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:48,008
Why don't you take your skanks
and get the hell out of here?

421
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:51,220
Until you make me a better offer,
there'll be no race.

422
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:55,307
If you win...
we'll give you the Whyte Wyrm.

423
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,313
You can expand your drug-dealing horizons
and upgrade out of this literal hellhole.

424
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:04,983
We'll take the Wyrm
and Sunnyside Trailer Park.

425
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,939
[Nick] Two turkey burgers
and a Cobb salad. To go.

426
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,151
Sharon.

427
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:23,903
Cheryl.

428
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,366
What are you still doing in town, Nick?

429
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,618
[Nick] Picking up some fuel
for the trip home.

430
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,286
How are you?

431
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:33,913
How am I?

432
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:37,875
How am I?

433
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:39,627
You roofied me.

434
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:44,131
- You tried to rape me.
- I don't think that's what happened.

435
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,426
You're a <i>Less Than Zero</i> monster.

436
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,471
At least I'm not a desperate tart
from a truck-stop town, hon.

437
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,975
Let's not distort reality
to cover your morning-after shame.

438
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:57,061
You were high, half-naked
and begging for it.

439
00:25:58,688 --> 00:25:59,730
Call your lawyer.

440
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,234
Seeing as you're
such an unrepentant spore,

441
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:05,611
I think I'll be pressing charges
after all.

442
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,407
Sweetie, did no one tell you
about the arrangement my parents made

443
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,158
with your cobra-like mother?

444
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,912
You're not gonna be saying anything
about that night to anyone.

445
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:19,125
After all, there's a reason
it's called hush money.

446
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,255
For the lady's meal, as well.

447
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:31,971
[Betty] God bless Reggie Mantle
and his inferiority complex.

448
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,600
His car's a lot like him.
It's beautiful to look at...

449
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,936
but not much going on under the hood.

450
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,898
Um, crescent wrench, please.

451
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,153
Thank you.

452
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,163
So, this is what Serpents do for fun, huh?
Street-race rival gangs?

453
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,165
[Jughead] Just go ahead and say it, Betty.

454
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,964
You said you weren't gonna join them, Jug.

455
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:10,718
And you said you loved me,
and then you dumped me via Archie.

456
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:15,723
Which, by the way,
way worse than via text.

457
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:17,975
[sighs]

458
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,728
I'm sorry, Jughead.

459
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,608
It won't make any sense...

460
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:31,405
but everything around us was imploding,
and I did it to protect you.

461
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:37,161
Betty, you did the one thing
that could actually hurt me.

462
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:40,998
I will explain everything to you, Jug,
I will.

463
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:46,045
But right now, I just wanna get you
through this race.

464
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,180
[Cheryl] I had the most fascinating chat
with Nick today.

465
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:59,558
Then I went rummaging around your bedroom
until I found this.

466
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:04,647
Before you start casting stones,
you should kn...

467
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:09,235
The Lodges are still accepting money
from the St. Clairs

468
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:13,322
- for their precious SoDale construction.
- I don't care about them.

469
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,282
I care about my mother.

470
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:21,789
You defend Daddy
even after he murdered your son...

471
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,127
but you won't stand up for me.

472
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:29,630
Not even against my would-be rapist.

473
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,799
Oh, don't be absurd, Cheryl.

474
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,135
And give me that check.

475
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,182
Not until you tell me the truth
about the Sugarman.

476
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,892
He exists, Mother.

477
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,352
We both know it.

478
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:45,062
He worked with Daddy.

479
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:46,814
Your father...

480
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:50,234
Was an awful human being,
and thank God he's dead.

481
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:53,320
But I'm alive, and I'm begging you...

482
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:57,742
for once in your life, be honest with me.

483
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,786
Care about me more.

484
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:10,045
It's simple.

485
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:14,091
The St. Clairs bought your silence.

486
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:17,803
But you're not getting paid
until I hear the truth.

487
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,187
What can I say...

488
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:29,190
or do...

489
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:32,526
to get you to stay here with me?

490
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,615
Instead of going to that dangerous...

491
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:41,619
dumb, possibly deadly street race?

492
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:44,997
Don't worry, Ronnie, I have a plan.

493
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:51,170
Like the plan you and Betty had
when you snuck into Ghoulie headquarters.

494
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,464
[Veronica chuckles]

495
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:59,178
- Touché.
- One that hopefully keeps everyone alive.

496
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,263
[cell phone buzzing]

497
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:04,975
Cheryl?

498
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,895
What? Slow down.

499
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:11,941
They what?

500
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:19,073
Are you still doing business
with the St. Clairs?

501
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:21,951
Letting them invest in SoDale
after what Nick did?

502
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:25,037
- To be fair, Cheryl's accusations...
- Cheryl's telling the truth.

503
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,165
I know, because Nick tried to do it to me.

504
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:34,088
Nick St. Clair... hurt you?

505
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,381
[Veronica] Tried to.

506
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:39,426
But I stopped him before he got too far.
The next night, he went after Cheryl.

507
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,389
- Veronica, why didn't you say something?
- I didn't have any proof.

508
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:46,225
And Nick has done it before,
I'm sure of it.

509
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:50,187
Veronica, as God is my witness,
I swear to you, I will...

510
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:54,108
Under no circumstances
will we take a penny from that family.

511
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:58,696
All right, let's do this!

512
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,239
[all] All right!

513
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:03,492
Not the kind of drag race
I ever imagined myself going to,

514
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:05,369
but at least the guys are hot.

515

[rock music playing]

516
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,374
[Archie] Don't worry, Ronnie, we got this.

517
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,167
Just make it back to me.

518
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,795
Preferably in one piece, Archiekins.

519
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,845
[Betty] Before you get in the car,
I need you to know...

520
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:28,392
I never stopped loving you, Jug.

521
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:31,478
I'm not sure I can.

522
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:37,484
Also remember, don't ride the clutch,
and don't let it slip between gear shifts.

523
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,529
You're an enigma, Cooper.

524
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,907
- Let's do it!
- [all] Yeah!

525
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,992
[crowd cheering]

526
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,371
[Tall Boy] Get these cars up in a row!

527
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,758
Race over Herk Harvey Bridge
to Dead Man's Curve.

528
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:02,426
First one back here wins.

529
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:05,429
- Uh, I usually do the honors.
- Not today, Cha-Cha.

530
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:07,139
I was born for this moment.

538
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,003
- Jug, we're coming up to the bridge.
- I know. I got this.

539
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:21,505
It's too narrow for both of us, Jughead.

540
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,804
Jug, we should abort.

541
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:31,181
- And let them win?
- We will both crash on that bridge.

542
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:34,393
Serpents are joining the Ghoulies
over my dead body, Archie.

543
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,605
I'm sorry, man,
but I'm not down for those terms.

544

Why would you do that?

546
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,787
Trust me, Jug,
you're gonna thank me for this.

547

[sirens wailing]

548
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:59,710
[Archie] Jug, stop! Jug! Jug!

549
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:00,627
Jug!

550
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:13,724
Come on, Jug, we gotta go. Come on.

551
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:21,122
Everyone scatter!
The cops are rounding up Ghoulies!

552
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:28,338
- [Veronica] Oh, my God, you're okay.
- We gotta get out of here.

553
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:31,007
- Come on, we gotta go. Right now.
- [Tall Boy] You called the cops?

554
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:34,469
You won't throw in with the Ghoulies,
but you will with cops?

555
00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:37,430
- Where's the honor in that?
- Calm down, Tall Boy.

556
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:40,392
- You think I knew Keller would be there?
- I called Keller.

557
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,269
What the hell, Archie?

558
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:44,020
Did my dad tell you about this, too?

559
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:47,148
No, this was my idea
to get rid of the Ghoulies. It worked.

560
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,442
They get arrested for racing,
they're off the chessboard.

561
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,361
For how long? One month? Three months?

562
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:53,488
You know what they'll want
on the other side?

563
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:56,199
Your head on a stake! All of ours!

564
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,256
Careful you don't get burned again.

565
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,844
You said I never protected you.

566
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:20,849
The Sugarman...

567
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,060
was a story I concocted...

568
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:28,440
to turn an all-too-real monster

569
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:30,483
into a child's bogeyman.

570
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:32,569
And it worked, for a while.

571
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:34,988
But now I need the truth.

572
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,703
Over the years,
there were many Sugarmen...

573
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:45,165
each taking over for the last.

574
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,337
When Clifford decided

575
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,632
to groom your brother
to take over the family business...

576
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:58,136
he wanted him
to meet the current Sugarman.

577
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:04,392
I protested, but your father insisted...

578
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:06,978
and God help me...

579
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:13,526
so began the terrible series of events
that led to Jason's death.

580
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:17,697
[sobs]

581
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,436
Thank you for that, Mommy.

582
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:53,233
One more question:
Who is the Sugarman right now?

583
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:57,028
[cell phone ringing]

584
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,615
Oh, my God, is that the Black Hood?

585
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:04,786
It's Cheryl.

586
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:07,205
Hey.

587
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:09,708
You did?

588
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:12,752
Who is he?

589
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:17,215
Wait, are you positive?

590
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,220
Betty?

591
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:27,058
Cheryl just told me the Sugarman's name.

592
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:30,729
Oh, my God, Cheryl Bombshell for the win.

593
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:33,732
[sighs]

594
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,985
What do I do, Veronica?

595
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,490
If I give the Black Hood his name,
may God have mercy on the Sugarman.

596
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,575
And if I don't...

597
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,078
may God have mercy on all of us.

598
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:52,783
[cell phone ringing]

599
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:02,043
I assume my time's up?

600
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:04,712
[Black Hood] <i>Yes, Betty.
Have you found him for me?</i>

601
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,005
I did.

602
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,175
<i>Good girl. Now tell me his name.</i>

603
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:13,054
I could.

604
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:17,350
But that wouldn't do you any good now.

605
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,103
I've already notified
the sheriff's office.

606
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:26,859
You'll have to read his name in the exposé
I just published in the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

607
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,404
Care to comment?

608
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:33,574
<i>I told you what would happen.</i>

609
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:39,372
The Sugarman needed to be brought
to justice, not execution.

610
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:42,208
He will be dealt with in the right way.

611
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,543
<i>You're playing a risky game.</i>

612
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,381
Yeah...

613
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,592
but it's my game now.

614
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,970
<i>Which is what, Betty?</i>

615
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:57,014
A game that ends with me catching you.

616
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:02,895
I found out who killed Jason Blossom.
I found out who the Sugarman was.

617
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:09,735
You're next, Black Hood.

618
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:14,657
I'm breathing down your neck.

619
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,035

Some people give you props for
challenging the Ghoulies and beating them.

624
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,092
Others hate that you
cut a deal with Keller

- because it puts us in bed with the pigs.
- I didn't. That was Archie.

- Honestly, Dad, I'm not sure.
