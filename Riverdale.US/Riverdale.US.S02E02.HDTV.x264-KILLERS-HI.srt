[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,946
[gunshot]

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,657
[Pop] This man,
his goal was something else.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,660
It was like the angel of death
had come to Riverdale.

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,869
[gasping]

6
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:12,913
- Hello, Dilton.
- Somebody has to teach them

7
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,122
to stand their ground.

8
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,583
[woman]
Your father's facing serious jail time.

9
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,503
[man] Serpents take care of their own.
We got your back.

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,090
Smithers, would you describe my father
as a good man?

11
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,384
- I'd rather not say, miss.
- I told your father

12
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,678
you were conflicted about helping him.

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,056
"If you do not testify, your mother
might be drawn into this mess."

14
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,892
Whether Sheriff Keller
finds the person who did this or not,

15
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:37,354
you don't have to worry.
I'm gonna protect you, I swear it.

00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,108
[Jughead] <i>Behold, Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.</i>

17
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,193
<i>For decades, the heart of Riverdale.</i>

18
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:47,572
What the hell?

19
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,203
[Jughead] <i>Now the latest casualty in the
town's ongoing battle against darkness.</i>

20
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:01,795
- Pop?
- [Pop] Did you see?

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,549
Did you see what they wrote
on my Chock'lit Shoppe?

22
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:10,721
[Archie] No, no, no.

23
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:15,183
- [Fred] Ahem. We need a fire extinguisher?
- What are you doing up?

24
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:18,270
- I was gonna bring you breakfast.
- I appreciate it,

25
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:20,897
but I gotta get to moving around sometime.

26
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:26,319
- Little early for that, isn't it?
- No, I'm good.

27
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:29,281
The only thing you need
to worry about is getting better.

28
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:30,407
[phone ringing]

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,076
Crap. I gotta take this. I gotta go. Bye.

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,205
Hi, Sheriff Keller?

31
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,293
No. No, deputy, I've been leaving messages
for the sheriff.

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,087
I need him to call me back
about my dad's case.

33
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,382
[sighs]

34
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,805
- TTFN, Smithers.
- [Smithers] Wait, Miss Veronica.

35
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,016
You might wanna take the side exit.

36
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,309
Why?

37
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,226
[door opens]

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,479
Yeah, why, Smithers?
Because she might bump into me

39
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:03,398
- coming in from an early run?
- [Veronica] Good morning, Father.

40
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,817
<i>Mija,</i> you leave before breakfast,

41
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,987
you come home after your mother and I
have had dinner.

42
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,865
I can't remember the last time
we had a meal together.

43
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,284
I can. It was at the Dakota.

44
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,869
The day you got arrested.

45
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:20,457
Well, perhaps we should talk
about that tonight, at dinner.

46
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,835
- The three of us.
- Unfortunately, I have plans.

47
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,129
To quote that <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon:

48
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,048
"How about never, Dad?

49
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,549
Is never good for you?"

50
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,136
[Jughead]
It's another win for the bad guys.

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,680
No one was there. His entire staff quit.

52
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,850
He's not sure how long
he'll be able to keep the doors open.

53
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,102
Maybe not even a week.

54
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:43,188
It's because of what happened to my dad.
People are freaking out.

55
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,982
I gotta be honest.
I don't see myself going back soon.

56
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,109
Wait, I'm sorry.

57
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,152
Am I hearing acceptance?

58
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,741
I'm not letting one psychopath with a gun
dictate what happens to our place.

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,787
Jug, you went crazy
trying to save the drive-in.

60
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,791
I can't take on any more social issues
right now.

61
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:03,917
My hands are full.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,546
With your dad, of course.
And he should be your priority.

63
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,509
- I'll take point on helping Pop Tate.
- [Veronica] I'll help.

64
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,178
Anything to get me away
from my parents, I'm in.

65
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,514
Another B and V team-up?

66
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,433
They should make a video game
about you guys. I gotta jet.

67
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:26,439
I'm off to meet my dad's court-appointed
joke of a lawyer at the sheriff's station.

68
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:29,359
Let me come. I gotta drop some flyers off
for Sheriff Keller.

69
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,277
[Betty] Bye.

70
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:38,743
[door opens]

71
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:41,997
[Keller] Thanks.

72
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:44,124
[Archie] Sheriff Keller.

73
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,377
Archie, how's your dad holding up?

74
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,172
He'd be better
if you caught the guy who shot him.

75
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,799
- We're doing everything we can.
- Me, too.

76
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,011
I'm out here handing out flyers,
talking to neighbors,

77
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:58,847
tracking my dad's credit cards.
His wallet is still missing.

78
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,725
Which means this guy
has all of our information,

79
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,352
including where we live.
And we were witnesses.

80
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,190
If your guys are out patrolling,
let me go with them.

81
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:09,649
- I can help.
- Well...

82
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,027
[woman over radio]
<i>Code 2, incident 5106. RD-6 took it.</i>

83
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,447
In Greendale? All right, copy that.
Give me a sec.

84
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,574
Let us do our job.

85
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,493
You take care.

86
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,958
Let's talk about the damn deal.

87
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,753
[man] First, to review the charges
you're facing,

88
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:33,840
arson, destruction of evidence,
making a false confession,

89
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,675
obstructing justice,

90
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,095
not to mention this whole nasty mess
of dumping a dead kid in the river.

91
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,388
I know what I did.

92
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,807
What's the deal?

93
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,145
- What are they offering?
- You're gonna wanna take it.

94
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:52,400
I've been doing this a long time.
It's a strong deal.

95
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,488
How many... damn... years?

96
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,746
[boards rattling]

97
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,176
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

98
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,594
[Archie] Jughead.

99
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,722
- Are you insane?
- You're the one that looks

100
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,850
like a Dream Warrior
from <i>Nightmare on Elm Street 3.</i>

101
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,228
What did the lawyer say?

102
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:34,859
I've been walking around trying
to wrap my head around how bad it is.

103
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,195
It's bad.

104
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,533
My dad is facing 20 years, Archie.

105
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,288
Crap, Jughead. I'm sorry. That sucks.

106
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,959
The lawyer thinks he should take the deal.

107
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:55,255
If he doesn't and the case goes to trial,
he could be facing 40 years.

108
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,511
I'm just really, really scared.

109
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:05,682
Yeah, me, too.

110
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:08,059
About what?

111
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:13,356
[gunshot]

112

Subtitles by explosiveskull

113
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:25,485
I couldn't sleep last night, Jug.
I kept thinking about your dad and Pop's

114
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:28,530
and how maybe we can kill two birds
with one stone.

115
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,365
We can...

116
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,579
Can you meet me at the mayor's office?

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,915
Okay, great. I'll get it set. Um...

118
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,793
- Right now I need to call...
- Hey, B, what's up?

119
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:44,921
[knock on door]

120
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,511
I know you haven't been sleeping
in your room,

121
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:55,015
so, where exactly
have you been spending your nights?

122
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,183
- [Archie] So, Betty.
- [Veronica] Yes, Betty.

123
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,227
Since you and your dad got home
from the hospital,

124
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:03,690
she's noticed your room has been
unusually empty and quiet. Why?

125
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,612
So I can... watch the doors.

126
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,990
So I can make sure no one comes in.

127
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,493
I know it sounds crazy,
but the guy who shot my dad

128
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,203
is still out there, Ronnie.

129
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:22,250
And I'm scared he's gonna... come back
and finish the job.

130
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,006
Archie, you went through something
deeply traumatic.

131
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:32,093
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Please. Anything.

132
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:35,513
When I lived in New York,
I saw a therapist once a week

133
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:38,767
to help me get through all sorts
of Park Avenue drama.

134
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:42,646
Now, I'm not saying
to go see a therapist, Archie,

135
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,565
but maybe the school counselor could help?

136
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:54,783
- Mayor McCoy.
- Betty, Jughead, what can I help you with?

137
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,869
So, the Chock'lit Shoppe
is on the verge of closing,

138
00:07:57,952 --> 00:08:01,831
and we want Pop Tate to know
that the town is rallying behind him.

139
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,795
We were thinking that you could make
the building a landmark

140
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,880
or declare a Pop's Day in support.

141
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,801
What if I endorse Pop's
and someone else is shot there?

142
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:16,221
My priority, as a mayor and as a mother,
is keeping this town safe.

143
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,432
If we have to close Pop's, I'm all for it.

144
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:23,978
Are you also all for shipping my dad off
to prison for a murder he didn't commit?

145
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:25,647
What is this, an ambush?

146
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,982
I know you have an in
with the state attorney.

147
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,236
If you could call him
and get my dad a better lawyer?

148
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,571
Your father made some mistakes.

149
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,283
- I'm sure he'll get a fair hearing.
- [Jughead] Mayor McCoy?

150
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,369
Remember this moment.

151
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:44,290
This is the moment you turned your back
on both Pop Tate and my father.

152
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:55,802
Midge Klump.

153
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,347
- The Klumpster.
- Reggie.

154
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,559
What do you know about jingle-jangle?

155
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,854
I know you shouldn't say it so loud
on school property.

156
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:10,567
And that I can score you some.
Who's it for?

157
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,154
- Me and Moose.
- Let me see what I can do.

158
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,788
What's on your mind, Andrews?

159
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,790
Girl troubles? Scabies?

160
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,753
Why are you seeking guidance
from Ms. Burble?

161
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,546
- I'm not.
- Maybe you should.

162
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,048
You look like my nuts
after football practice.

163
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,719
Hey. Do you have anything
that can help keep me awake?

164
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:38,970
Many things.

165
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:43,433
Amphetamines, baclofen,
modafinil, jingle-jangle.

166
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:44,809
Jingle-jangle?

167
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:49,647
That'll keep you up for days,
in more ways than one.

168
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,943
Why do you need uppers, Wonder Bread?

169
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,489
Until the guy who shot my dad is caught,
I wanna be on high alert.

170
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:01,409
- Can you help me or not, Reggie?
- I got you, Andrews.

171
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,499
[Betty] <i>We can't let the terrorists win.</i>

172
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:12,045
We need to host an event at Pop's
that reminds the town of simpler times.

173
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,089
A throwback to when the Shoppe
first opened its doors.

174
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:18,802
Betty... I like a good milkshake
as much as any girl,

175
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:24,724
and Pop's puts Serendipity 3's to shame,
but why this hill to die on?

176
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,482
Orange freezes with my mom
and Polly after ballet.

177
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,277
Chicken noodle soup with my dad
after ice-skating.

178
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:40,156
Grilled cheeses with Archie
on the last day of summer vacation.

179
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:44,244
[Betty] <i>It's where I met you
for the first time, V.</i>

180
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,205
It's where I met you for the first time.

181
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:50,875
Also...

182
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,294
Jug.

183
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,091
He may lose his dad...

184
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,306
but maybe I can save this one place
for him, for all of us.

185
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:06,683
[knocking on door]

186
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,476
Hey, Veronica.

187
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,562
May I speak to you?

188
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,188
Daddy?

189
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,356
- Daddy?
- Daddy?

190
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:18,278
Every day I was in prison, I thought
about getting back to you and your mother.

191
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,656
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
I knew it would take time.

192
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,494
Meet me halfway.

193
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,538
Don't you think I want to, Daddy?

194
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,792
Don't you think I want everything
to go back to the way it was?

195
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,254
The three of us
walking into some fabulous gala or ball,

196
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,756
you with your two favorite girls.

197
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,010
But... I can't.

198
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,764
The blindfold's off.
I can't put it back on.

199
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,019
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,647
- I should get back to my friends.
- Yeah. Hey, so...

201
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:59,611
- are you, uh, planning a dance in there?
- An event to keep Pop's from closing.

202
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,863
- If I can help...
- I'll let you know.

203
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:07,285
I tried going the legit route.
I talked to the mayor.

204
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:10,038
It feels like the system is rigged
against us.

205
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,707
What's FP saying? Is he taking this deal?

206
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,417
Not if I can help it.

207
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:15,877
Tall Boy...

208
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,841
what if we bust him out of jail
before he gets transferred to state?

209
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:28,139
It's doable. The sheriff's station has
worse security than Riverdale High.

210
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,892
Once he's out,
it's a straight shot up Sweetwater River

211
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,518
until the Canadian border.

212
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:36,022
You've seen <i>Escape From Alcatraz</i>
a few too many times, kid.

213
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:38,691
Your dad needs a snake handler.

214
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:41,319
Someone whose livelihood
depends on snakes,

215
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:45,073
who's used to dealing with them.
I got someone you should meet.

216
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:50,119
Humpty and Dumpty.
Just in time to meet our newest recruit.

217
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,705
In addition to my duties as a Pussycat.

218
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,668
And I just wanna say, girls,
I'm so excited to work on my moves

219
00:12:56,751 --> 00:13:00,129
and to be a team player,
as long as I'm in the front.

220
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:05,176
Wait, Cheryl, does that mean
you're taking the Vixens back from me?

221
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:08,680
But really, Veronica,
were they ever yours?

222
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:13,017
Cheryl, we were wondering
if maybe the Vixens would help

223
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,228
at an event to save Pop's.

224
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:22,485
Oh, Betty, I did not emerge
from the frozen depths of Sweetwater River

225
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,863
nor the flames of Thornhill
to allow my Vixens to sling milkshakes

226
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:30,243
at some death-cursed diner.
The answer is a double-cherry-on-top no.

227
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,369
[bell rings]

228
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:35,498
Okay.

229
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,291
Good talk.

230
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,293
[Weatherbee]
<i>May I have everyone's attention?</i>

231
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,422
I have some...

232
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,507
tragic news to share.

233
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,593
Ms. Grundy...

234
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,140
who was a teacher here last semester,
was found...

235
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,186
- murdered in her Greendale home.
- Oh, my God.

236
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,525
[Weatherbee] I know some of you
were students of hers...

237
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,988
and that this news
will be difficult to process.

238
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,490
[inaudible]

239
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:13,786
[gunshot]

240
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:20,877
Mr. Andrews?

241
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,207
[Archie] First you get shot.

242
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,669
Then Ms. Grundy is murdered.
All within a matter of days.

243
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:35,381
What if some crazy person
is going after people I care about?

244
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:36,465
[sighs]

245
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:39,969
- What? You think I'm nuts.
- No, son, I think you're scared.

246
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:41,971
Understandably so.

247
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:45,725
Truth is, we don't know anything
about what happened to Ms. Grundy.

248
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:48,394
She's dead. She was killed...

249
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,480
right across Sweetwater River.

250
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:53,149
I know.

251
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,109
It was a horrible thing.

252
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,697
Don't you wanna find out who did this?
Who's doing this?

253
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:23,012
I'm, uh...

254
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:24,722
here for Penny Peabody?

255
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,358
Forgive the office space,
but I'm a firm believer in low overhead.

256
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:40,529
- Plus, I like being close to my clients.
- Your clients being the Serpents?

257
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,865
Well, I was and still am a Serpent.

258
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,411
They put me through college.

259
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:48,871
Law school.

260
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:53,209
Right. Serpents are often
on the other side of the law,

261
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:57,380
so, having one of their own
on retainer helping out, it's clever.

262
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,675
FP always bragged that you were smart.

263
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:04,178
Oh, yeah, I know your dad.

264
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:09,350
And I also know,
from our, um... mutual friends,

265
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,102
the deal he's been offered.

266
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:13,270
It's garbage.

267
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,400
- Can you help?
- I know the loopholes.

268
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,402
In this case, there are none.

269
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,738
But if you get the victim's family
to forgive him

270
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:27,743
in front of a judge,
that might shift things in FP's favor.

271
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,497
Instead of 20 years,
he can get time served with parole.

272
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,499
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:38,337
Thank... Uh...
Am I... supposed to pay you, or...?

274
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:39,922
We're friends.

275
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:46,220
I do you a favor,
one day, maybe you do me a favor.

276
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,559
Let me know how it goes, will you?

277
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,645
Tell your dad to wear a tie.

278
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:58,816
You're twitching, Archie,
which means this must be serious.

279
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,738
I think the person who shot my dad
may have murdered Ms. Grundy.

280
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:08,451
My, my. We've come a long way
since dances at the gym

281
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:10,995
and varsity football tryouts, haven't we?

282
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,624
You were the first to know anything
about Jason's autopsy.

283
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,753
- Archie's wondering if...
- I can get details on Ms. Grundy's death

284
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,005
and see if they line up
with the attack on Fred.

285
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,383
It would be really helpful
to put Archie's mind at ease.

286
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,762
Fine. I'll reach out
to my ghoulish friend.

287
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:31,057
Thank you, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks, Betty.

288
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:32,892
I should go.

289
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:35,102
I'll call you, Arch.

290
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,690
Spreading ourself thin

291
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,985
as the patron saint of lost causes,
aren't we?

292
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,322
You can cross saving Pop's off your list.

293
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,950
Haven't you heard?
Pop Tate is selling the Shoppe.

294
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,536
What? To who?

295
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,372
To, and you'll love this,
an anonymous buyer.

296
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,541
Ring any bells?

297
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:01,337
[phone ringing]

298
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,881
- Miss Veronica, I'll take those.
- Oh, thank you, Smithers.

299
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,883
Hey, girl.

300
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:10,721
What?

301
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:14,225
Are you buying Pop's
the way you bought the drive-in?

302
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:15,559
Anonymously?

303
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,855
And are you doing this just to buy me?

304
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,818
Yesterday did you think,
"Veronica's working so hard

305
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,737
to save the Chock'lit Shoppe,
I'll save it for her."

306
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:29,156
Veronica, I'm not buying Pop's.

307
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,910
Now, please, lower your voice and sit...

308
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:35,412
so we can speak civilly.

309
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,209
- You wanna talk, Dad?
- That's all I've wanted. A fair hearing.

310
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,377
To explain myself.

311
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,922
Okay.

312
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,092
Let's talk about Mr. Andrews.

313
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,765
Mom asked him to sell his portion
of the SoDale project.

314
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,768
And the day after he rejected the offer...

315
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:02,231
he was shot in Pop's.

316
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,611
- Was it your doing?
- [Hermione] Veronica.

317
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,322
- First you accuse me, then your father?
- No.

318
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:11,657
No.

319
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,576
I didn't shoot Fred.

320
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:16,745
Nor did I hire someone to do it.

321
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,126
I was your fiercest protector, Dad.

322
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,507
Ask Mom. Whenever somebody called you
the devil incarnate, I defended you.

323
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,928
I kept telling myself, "He's not that bad.

324
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,931
You can forgive him."

325
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,477
And then you sent me this.

326
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,655
A letter threatening you, Mom.

327
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:04,919
That's the kind of man
you're letting back into our lives.

328
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,177
[Hermione] Veronica...

329
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,264
your father didn't write this.

330
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:20,017
I did.

331
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:24,897
I don't understand.

332
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,775
I needed you to testify
on your father's behalf.

333
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:33,030
So, I wrote this letter
threatening myself, not your father.

334
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:33,948
[Hiram] Yeah.

335
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:35,866
She did it for us...

336
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:37,952
to survive.

337
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,621
So we can be a family again.

338
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,417
You two deserve each other.

339
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,718
[Jughead]
It's not exactly downsizing, is it?

340
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:55,928
[knocking on door]

341
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:57,930
Hobo.

342
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,473
Bride of hobo.

343
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,392
Welcome to Thistlehouse.

344
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,894
Mother's in the conservatory. Follow me.

345
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,155
Thank you for sitting down with us.

346
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,908
Of course, Betty. You're family.

347
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,036
[Jughead] Okay.

348
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,665
The reason we're here...

349
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:30,796
FP's lawyer thinks that if the family
of the victim shows mercy...

350
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,256
Mercy.

351
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,676
That's why you're here?

352
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:40,472
Well, it's an appeal for leniency
from you...

353
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,600
to reduce my dad's sentence.

354
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,770
Where was your father's mercy
when I spent those nights

355
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,355
walking Thornhill in agony,

356
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:52,234
obsessing over what was happening
to J.J., imagining the worst?

357
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:54,945
Where was it
when I slept under the same roof

358
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,656
- as a killer night after night?
- Cheryl.

359
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,367
FP didn't kill Jason.

360
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,787
Okay? That was your dad.

361
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,205
You saw the video.

362
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,668
If it were up to me,
I'd watch FP fry in the electric chair.

363
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,297
We need this sordid chapter
closed forever,

364
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,841
and FP is the last loose end to tie up.

365
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:18,969
I will not have a living,
breathing reminder

366
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:22,222
of the darkest chapter of my life
walking the streets of Riverdale.

367
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:27,686
What do we do now
that Cheryl's gone full Poison Ivy?

368
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,022
Blackmail, extortion.

369
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:35,194
If they weren't literally an orphan
and a widow, I would do it.

370
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:47,122
[man] Lacerations on the neck.
Her trachea's crushed.

371
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:51,293
Broken veins in her eyes,
and the skin tears suggest brutality.

372
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,003
This is a crime of passion.

373
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,091
Hatred. He wanted to feel her struggle
as she died.

374
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,970
Tell me, Mrs. Cooper,
did you know the victim?

375
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:04,306
No.

376
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,856
[man] Give me your wallet!

377
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,027
[grunting]

378
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,449
[Reggie] Stop it.

379
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,535
Stop!

380
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,120
It's me.

381
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,207
- Are you insane?
- What are you doing here?

382
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,502
Delivering your uppers.
Clearly the last thing you need.

383
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:39,174
- You've lost it, Andrews.
- You're the one here wearing this hood.

384
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:42,678
It's called a prank.
I didn't expect you to attack me.

385
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,639
What if I had been the guy, huh?

386
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:49,309
- You would have just tackled him?
- Yeah. Damn right.

387
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:52,020
He has a gun, Andrews.

388
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,272
He's shot people.

389
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:57,609
Only a dumb-ass lunatic
brings a bat to a gunfight.

390
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,876
There was no sign of forced entry,
which probably means she knew her killer.

391
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:11,172
The police don't know
if any of her belongings were taken.

392
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:14,301
How, uh...?

393
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:17,095
How did Ms. Grundy die?

394
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,099
The autopsy showed
that she was strangled...

395
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:25,020
with something the killer grabbed on hand.

396
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:28,064
A cello bow, of all things.

397
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:34,362
There was a struggle. She fought back.

398
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,782
But, Archie, this was a crime of passion,

399
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:41,786
in another town,
with a completely different murder weapon.

400
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:47,500
The likelihood of these two crimes
being connected seems slim.

401
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,086
Son?

402
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:54,924
If I say what I'm thinking,
you'll think I'm crazy.

403
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,429
Probably Mrs. Cooper is right.

404
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:03,266
Probably they're not connected.

405
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,188
So, why'd you do it? Did they make you
an offer you couldn't refuse?

406
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,358
- Who's buying it? Do you know?
- [Pop] It shames me to say...

407
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,861
- ChugMo.
- The liquor-store chain?

408
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:20,325
- Could I make a request for a last supper?
- Anything you want.

409
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:23,244
It's not for me. It's for my dad.

410
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:26,956
He's facing 20 years
of that weird meat loaf

411
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,541
that they serve prisoners.

412
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,127
So, barring an 11th-hour miracle, I was...

413
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,590
hoping, for his last meal in Riverdale,
that you could make his favorite.

414
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:40,679
Fried chicken, corn bread, onion rings
and orange freeze, if memory serves.

415
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:42,889
That's very <i>Rain Man</i> of you, Pop.

416
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:44,641
Been doing this a long time.

417
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,894
Thought I'd be doing it
until the day I die.

418
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:49,646
[Betty] This is...

419
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:52,732
unacceptable.

420
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,277
- What?
- Just everything.

421
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:01,282
- Have you officially sold the diner?
- The contract's being drawn up.

422
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:02,325
Do not sign it.

423
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,911
Okay? Do not give up. Either of you.

424
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:09,457
I can fix this, all right?
I will fix this, okay?

425
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:10,959
Bye.

426
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,471
[door closes, then Cheryl gasps]

427
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:27,976
- Give a girl a warning, will you?
- You want closure.

428
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:32,147
- I wanna help my boyfriend's dad.
- I told you...

429
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,732
And I'm telling you...

430
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:37,318
to help FP or...

431
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:38,820
Or what?

432
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,657
Or I wide-release the video
of your father shooting Jason.

433
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:47,537
Try having closure
with that out in the world.

434
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,584
I thought you, uh, gave that
damn thumb drive to Sheriff Keller.

435
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:55,712
No, not before I saved a copy
onto Jughead's laptop.

436
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:03,762
One click and the darkest chapter
of your family's twisted psychodrama

437
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:05,930
becomes a viral sensation.

438
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:08,558
Are you threatening me?

439
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:11,311
This?

440
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:13,772
No.

441
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:18,818
No, this is... fun girl talk.

442
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,866
You could save a man's life.

443
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:27,827
Think about that.

444
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,999
A nice ending to a sad story.

445
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:39,756
If I testify, you're giving me that video

446
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:44,385
and a guarantee that all copies
in your possession will be erased.

447
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:47,055
You have my word.

448
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:49,891
Also...

449
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,853
I need the Vixens for Retro Night.

450
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,485
You're a stone-cold bitch, Betty Cooper.

451
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:13,998
I don't have red hair and broad shoulders.

452
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:16,251
Or a blond ponytail, for that matter.

453
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:19,671
Do you wanna talk?

454
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:28,847
You were ready to walk away from your dad.

455
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:33,351
And now you're crusading for his freedom.

456
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:35,478
What changed?

457
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:39,023
He did.

458
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:41,192
He made an effort.

459
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,612
Took another swing at being a good dad.

460
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:48,867
But don't you think...

461
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,619
some people can't change?

462
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:55,540
Like it's just in their DNA to be bad?

463
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,296
I'm not gonna presume to know
what lies in your father's heart.

464
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,840
But Archie's dad almost died.

465
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:08,094
And my dad is going away for 20 years.

466
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:14,767
If there's even a 0.0001 percent chance
that your dad is trying...

467
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:16,102
I get it.

468
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:20,398
Thank you, Jughead.

469
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:24,861
Sheriff, I believe the man who shot my dad
is the person

470
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:28,031
that killed Ms. Grundy,
and I think I know who it is.

471
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:31,367
Well, that's quite a statement, Archie.

472
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:33,703
Ms. Grundy had an abusive ex-husband.

473
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:36,080
She moved to Riverdale to get away.

474
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:39,083
She kept a gun in her car
in case he'd come back.

475
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,544
And how do you know all this?

476
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:44,297
Because she and I were...

477
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:48,509
We were close.

478
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:51,054
And I'm thinking he found out about me.

479
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,016
Ms. Grundy was killed with a cello bow.

480
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:59,604
I gave her one before she left Riverdale.
I'm betting it's the murder weapon.

481
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:03,233
Can't you see? He's sending me a message.

482
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:05,151
Your theory's wrong, Archie.

483
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:08,488
My counterparts at Greendale
already brought in her ex.

484
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,740
And he has an airtight alibi.

485
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:19,916
Maybe everyone's right.

486
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:24,671
Maybe I am going crazy.

487
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,046
[Kevin] Hey, has Betty called?

488
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:38,926
Not yet.
Let's pray Cheryl comes through for them.

489
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,054
[man] <i>Ms. Blossom,
you may proceed with your statement.</i>

490
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:45,724
Your Honor, I speak for myself
and my mother when I say...

491
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:50,896
we forgive FP Jones for the part he played
in covering up my brother's murder.

492
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,859
And we humbly ask the court for leniency.

493
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,946
FP's guilt has been blown
out of proportion

494
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,699
to satiate what my father's suicide
denied us.

495
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:04,243
Closure.

496
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:09,498
As much as I sympathize, I can't ignore
the quality of Mr. Jones' crimes.

497
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:12,293
There were no extenuating circumstances.

498
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:19,717
My father threatened him.

499
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:22,845
I overheard them talking in Daddy's study.

500
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,891
Daddy said he'd hurt Jughead
if FP didn't comply.

501
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:32,897
Is that extenuating enough?

502
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,569
[judge] In light of these revelations,

503
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,405
I suggest that we take a step back

504
00:31:41,488 --> 00:31:44,450
and reevaluate certain aspects
of the case.

505
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:48,162
At which time, we will revisit sentencing.

506
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:50,205
Adjourned.

507
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,048
Is that a win?

508
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,175
It's a delay, so, yeah.

509
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:14,313
No one's here.

510
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:16,565
No one's coming.

511
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:18,984
It's still early, okay?

512
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:25,115
Mom.

513
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,203
- Did you come to gloat?
- Don't be so cynical, Elizabeth.

514
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:32,289
I came to write my next story
over one last root-beer float.

515
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,833
I'm calling it "Requiem for Pop's."

516
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,335
Can I get a quote, dear?

517
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:39,254
You're a fiend, mother.

518
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:42,800
But this is one obituary
you're not gonna write.

519
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:47,429
All right.

520
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:52,768
Two strawberries, one vanilla,
and one chocolate with extra malt.

521
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,064
[clears throat]

522
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,651
Why did you broadcast
all over social media

523
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:04,321
that the Pussycats would be doing
a free concert here?

524
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:06,824
I knew if I asked, you would have said...

525
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:10,703
No. If my mom even hears
that I set foot in this place...

526
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,746
Josie, you care about this place.

527
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,374
I know you do.
I see you here all the time.

528
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,003
Betty, even if I wanted to help,
I'm down a Cat.

529
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:21,380
- Valerie has norovirus.
- I don't mind stepping in.

530
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:25,134
If you can be a River Vixen,
Josie, I can be a Pussycat.

531
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,345
As long as it's a cover,
I'll know the lyrics.

532
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:30,556
You do love your cheese fries.

533
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:35,102
Fine. Fine.

00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:31,742
You made it.

548
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,369
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah.

549
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,039
Just taking deep breaths.

550
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:38,749
I'm proud of you.

551
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,586
Come on.

552
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:45,798
You take a booth,
and I'll get you a shake.

553
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,642
I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to be supportive.

554
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:58,352
Dad, Mom.

555
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:00,270
I've been thinking.

556
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:05,901
Tonight is a new beginning for Pop's,
and maybe it can be for us, too.

557
00:35:06,777 --> 00:35:09,196
That's up to you.
If that's what you want.

558
00:35:09,863 --> 00:35:11,365
Let's try.

559
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:15,702
- But, you guys, total transparency, okay?
- Yes. Of course.

560
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:18,831
From now on. In the spirit of that,

561
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:22,668
I propose that Lodge Industries
make a charitable contribution.

562
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:44,189
Relax, Betty.

563
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:48,694
I'm sure they're just here to enjoy
Pop's world-class burgers and service.

564
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,905
Just like me.

565
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:56,368
Ugh, you two are like chimps in captivity,
grooming and picking lice off each other.

566
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,081
Mark this day in your diary.
I lied under oath for you.

567
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:03,667
- Thank God I'm quick on my feet.
- Cheryl...

568
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,087
thank you.

569
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:10,841
Honor your promise to me.

570
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,394
Hi, Midge, Moose.

571
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:26,356
I've got your jingle-jangle.

572
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:27,983
[camera clicks]

573
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:35,407
[Pop] I gotta put her on the spot.

574
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,621
It's thanks to this young lady here
that Pop's gets to stay open tonight,

575
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:43,457
tomorrow, as long as you folks
keep coming.

576
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,126
[cheering]

577
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:51,131
Thanks also to the Lodge family

578
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:54,885
for a donation they just made
that gives us a little cushion

579
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:57,095
to weather any storm that might come up.

580
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:59,306
[cheering]

581
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,228
I didn't know
we were in the charity business.

582
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,395
Oh, we're not.

583
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,524
As of five minutes ago,
we, uh, own this diner.

584
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,655
In exchange for his silence,
I told Tate he could stay on as manager.

585
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,242
Nice to have you back, Hiram.

586
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:22,663
Thank you for saying
you wrote that letter.

587
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,832
Veronica never would've forgiven me
for that.

588
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,335
Once again, your loyalty knows no bounds.

589
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:38,053
Ronnie, should I introduce myself
to your dad?

590
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,266
You've faced enough dragons for one night.
Next time, Archiekins.

591
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:46,812
[Betty] So, I guess tonight is a win
for the good guys.

592
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,565
A rare win, but yes.

593
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:52,484
Thanks to you, Betty.

594
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:53,443
You okay?

595
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:57,990
I'm here with you guys.

596
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:00,409
So, yeah, I think so.

597
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:16,022
[Cheryl] I have a present for you.

598
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,403
The video of Daddy and Jason.

599
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:27,617
All cued up.

600
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:33,206
It might bring you peace.

601
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:43,841
[man] Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge.

602
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:47,345
- You must be Veronica.
- I am. Where's Smithers?

603
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:49,931
He didn't he tell you?
His mother fell ill.

604
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:53,518
He went overseas to care for her.
Did he leave a forwarding address?

605
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,145
- I'll try to track one down, sir.
- Thank you, Andre.

606
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:06,781
[phone ringing]

607
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,579
- Hello?
- You went to see Penny Peabody?

608
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:17,709
- [FP] <i>You asked her for help?</i>
- Dad. Hey.

609
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,504
Uh, yeah. We didn't have a choice.
Is something wrong?

610
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:23,464
Did you...? Did you pay her?

611
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,260
- No, she said it was a favor.
- [FP] <i>Jughead, listen to me.</i>

612
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:31,681
Do not contact her again.
If she reaches out, don't respond.

613
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,016
You do not wanna be in bed

614
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,935
- with the Snake Charmer.
- [Jughead] <i>Why...?</i>

615
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:37,562
Dad?

616
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:52,785
You do know that several drug deals
went down here tonight?

617
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:56,164
- What?
- And if you think Hiram Lodge,

618
00:39:56,247 --> 00:40:00,376
Riverdale's answer to Scarface,
helped Pop Tate for altruistic reasons,

619
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,671
- I have a bridge to sell you.
- Mom...

620
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,215
The Serpents have now officially
crossed the tracks

621
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,677
and have a toehold on the Northside,
so, congratulations.

622
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:14,557
You're almost single-handedly responsible
for giving crime a haven in Riverdale.

623
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:22,774
[Jughead] <i>And far from the glow of Pop's
neon sign, on Sweetwater Bridge,</i>

624
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:27,320
<i>Archie Andrews had arranged
a secret rendezvous with Dilton Doiley.</i>

625
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,240
Hey, Dilton.

626
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:35,578
Hey, Archie. I got what you asked for.

627
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,345
I'm not crazy.

628
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:56,265
The guy's still out there.
It's for protection.

629
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:58,309
Sure, Archie.

630
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,353
Whatever you say.

631
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:05,024
[Jughead] <i>That night, for the first time
in weeks, Archie would sleep...</i>

632
